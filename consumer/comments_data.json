It's an asset.\n\nBeing an asset doesn't make it money.\n\n>There are plenty.\n\n>Sending money outside of banking hours is 1 niche.\n\nYou can't send money outside of banking hours with Bitcoin because you still need to exchange Bitcoin for money, which requires banks.\n\n>While it does take time, so does any cash transaction where the recipient is not physically next to you.\n\n>Try sending cash to someone who is 2 hours away. Bitcoin would be faster.\n\nZelle is faster, and usually immediately withdrawable from an ATM. Including after banking hours.\n\n>This is not true. Those processing networks are centralized and controlled by entities. Bitcoin is not. (and neither is a physical cash transaction)\n\nSo? You are ignoring literally every other characteristic that Bitcoin shares with digital transactions and holding up \"decentralization\" and \"finality\" on pedestals as THE distinguishing characteristics that make it equivalent to cash. That's called cherrypicking.\n\nNever mind the fact that exchanging Bitcoin for money still requires those same centralized entities.\n\nAt the end of the day, a complete Bitcoin transaction has far more in common with debit and credit card transactions than with cash transactions.\n\n>Why do I (and you) care what anonymous posters online say? I can find crazy anonymous posters from ANY position saying crazy stupid shit.\n\nLink #1 is to a book titled \"The Bitcoin Standard\"\n\nLink #2 is to an interview with the Coinbase CEO\n\nLink #3 is to an article speculating about the adoption of a Bitcoin standard\n\nNONE of these are \"crazy anonymous posters,\" at least by r/CryptoCurrency standards.\n\n>Financial reserve assets does not equal what the gold standard was.\n\nGold as a financial reserve asset was a prerequisite to the gold standard, and cryptobros want a Bitcoin standard."

First log on at an exchange listed on coin market cap. The PIP official listings are, gate/kucoin/coinx/tapbit. Whne you log on, you need USDT to buy nay coin, so, first, buy USDT Using buy crypto. Next, go to spot or market search area, and search for PIP. Since this is a valuable coin, LIMIT orders will not fill.

      "> If you're making semantic arguments why can't I do the same\n\nYou can do that all you want, but that's not what you've done. Your argument seems to be that you googled the words \"DAO\" and \"rollback\" and found a bunch of poorly written and researched articles that uses the word \"rollback\" incorrectly as some sort of appeal to authority.\n\nLike I've already said, a rollback means reverting the state to a previous state and rolling back all the transactions in a particular block or sequence of blocks, which isn't what happened. Instead there was an irregular statechange which allowed the funds to be recovered by the DAO token holders. Technically the funds from the DAO contract and daughter contracts were moved into a new recovery contract from where token holders could redeem their ETH.\n\n>It also ignores the main point by distracting (using semantic arguments) from the main point which is that transactions on the blockchain were not permanent.\n\nNo it doesn't. The only point I've ever argued was that technically it's not correct to say there was a rollback and it's not correct to argue that there's been any downtime or \"missed blocks\" which is what this post is about. You're the one who's now deciding to introduce a new \"main point\" because I presume you realise you've gone and wasted everyone's time by arguing about some BS you don't really understand."

In 2017 people didn't talk about the 4 year cycle (not many anyway, and largely ignored)but in 2021 it was talked about as we seemed to be following the same pattern. The early top and subsequent recovery pushed many people to think there was no longer a 4 year cycle. Same as this year, people are saying it is too big now for the cycle, will go up forever, supercycle etc.   \n  \nWhen people are optimistic they don't think about the potential black swans that could line up and push us into bear market (e.g. leaked Epstein video of Trump, yet another war, a trade war, some shit with AI, natural disaster etc). It doesn't take much to switch sentiment, think back to earlier this year, everyone said it was all over. \n\nI hope I'm wrong but I see the cycle continuing, not until next year can it be dismissed."

      "I guess I failed to mention the other related point, you also can\u2019t own anything on the blockchain without legislation and courts, the blockchain cannot independently provide ownership, making it redundant, ie\n\nThe blockchain can only provide a receipt of ownership. Who says the receipt is valid in a dispute? A court. If you need a court to resolve disputes, what does it matter if the receipt is from a centralized agency or a distributed network of 10,000 miners?\n\nLegislation also needs to be passed to make that enforceable. For example, if I had my car on the blockchain but I sold the car on Craig\u2019s list and never mentioned the token, does the new owner still own the car? Yes. The token claiming ownership is useless. How can it be enforced if a law says the token is proof of ownership? They would have to legislate that all car must have a token and that customers are at fault for not collecting the token with the car title. So now we have the government and the courts involved, why bother with the blockchain? The government can issue transferable digital titles without the need for a blockchain."

If that happens he\u2019ll blame Bitcoin and the attitude will flip 180 as he starts prosecuting crypto executives for running a Ponzi scheme, committing fraud, etc.  Then he\u2019ll seize tokens and roll out heavy regulations on miners to basically secure total censorship power over L1.\n\nHe\u2019ll roll out a wealth tax on crypto holdings and use the proceeds to fund an insurance pool called the Economic Stability Fund.\n\nHe can ban Bitcoin then seize all funds held by MSTR, Coinbase, Marathon, Blackrock, and all the big players under US jurisdiction.  \n\nThese are just a handful of the things he can do to completely rug pull trillions out of the economy to strengthen the dollar (people who lose all their bitcoin will be broke and therefore have higher demand for dollars).\n\nTrump is clearly lining up the dominoes so he can knock them down when the time comes.\n\nCrypto undermines the dollar which is the source of all government power.  There is no way the government will keep supporting it all the way through to a dollar collapse."

Everyone understands that sooner or later the world will switch to an electronic financial system that will be easier to control. And also in this new system there will be an opportunity to earn money out of thin air for activity in a certain community.

      "A Base58Check-encoded address showing consistent partial matches across many attempts would be statistically improbable if it were happening beyond pure chance. But here's the thing: Bitcoin addresses aren't raw outputs of ECC or SHA-256 alone; they go through multiple layers, including SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, a version prefix, a checksum, and finally Base58Check encoding. So a \u201c33% match\u201d in address characters might feel significant, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily imply proximity in key space. Base58 encoding isn't linear, and small character overlaps don\u2019t mean the inputs are mathematically close. If your AI is consistently getting partial matches better than chance across millions of samples, then yes, that would be noteworthy. But you need to verify that your dataset is truly random and not biased; for example, if you\u2019re sampling from a narrow subset of keys, burn addresses, or vanity address prefixes, the character distributions might not reflect the true address space. It\u2019s also important to compare your results against a statistical baseline for random attempts, and ensure your parsing of Base58Check addresses is correct. Some characters appear more frequently than others due to the checksum and version byte structure, which can skew superficial comparisons. If the anomaly holds under careful scrutiny, but chances are this is due to random noise, encoding quirks, or flawed assumptions in the match criteria. Still, it's good you're probing it; asking these kinds of questions."

This does depend on what your platform is with buying Bitcoin though. Some charge too much to do that. I use Strike. After one week, there's no fee anymore but at any time you decide to adjust that DCA, you have to restart the one week fees. Spread price to spot price is extremely close to exact as the DCA makes purchases. I recommend daily because a lot can happen in a week.

      "Here's the reality. The vast majority of Americans and people from the industrialized world are completely priced out from ever becoming whole coiners if they currently have very little or no BTC. The only exceptions would be those who have a lot of disposable income OR those who have a high net worth in other assets (real estate, etc.) that are willing to convert this into BTC. Out of these individuals, very few are going to be comfortable or have the conviction to flip near 6 figures or more into an asset class they are completely new to.\n\nNow, for everyone else who is interested in BTC there still is an opportunity to do quite well. Given how much BTC Michael Saylor, BlackRock and other big entities are buying this asset is quickly becoming VERY scarce. We are getting into a territory now where .1 BTC is and will be a big deal, so I think this is a very good goal for people that are just getting into the market. As I'm writing this it would cost roughly 12k, which is feasible but not at all easy for most people. If we get into a bear market and see lows of 70-80k this becomes much easier but still could be a challenge for many.\n\nThe last time for new investors to become whole coiners was 2022 through late 2023. Holding .1 BTC will be on the table for a good amount of time from here for people who are willing to pull the trigger, but eventually this mark will become out of reach. Eventually .01 BTC will be difficult and so on."

Some people here in Ukraine found this hard way when they were forced to flee and than their backup locations were destroyed as well or are inaccessible due to being on the front line or covered my land mines. Also, while impossible to hack, offline backups are much easier to steal/ seize. It was discussed many times that most people are very bad at hiding things. Basically it is not easier to do offline backups properly than online ones. It is just that people are more scared of \"digital\" risks while all stories we hear about hacked wallets are usually about non-existent opsec (like creating seed on your home PC without using fresh system, or downloading fake wallet, or using web sites for seed generation etc).\n\nSecond, you never can have zero risk, and in this case risk is really low - to get things like tampered keyboard with keylogger or something similar means you are specifically targeted.

Now I've never checked on it never wrote down the site and the wallet address or what ever was really long different numbers and symbols and letters.

Firstly Bitcoin is not about the value of the coins but about the value of the address itself , the security and work behind it. Empty unused wallets with no transactions ever should each be worth a single coin in my opinion. But obviously that does not help platforms that have deviated my works. - I do have a legal document ready to represent with my keys and signiture to demonstrate that I could Dump 100,000 + keys and destablise the value of bitcoin and all systems that come after it at any time , because bitcoin is the fundmentally most trusted crypto currency on earth. I Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the software till the about the third month of 2011 and started as a Hobby when 17. I currently have a wallet with early signitures of typical wif address (30 of them) under one password. - Addresses releated to the same password, my real name as a password, my family members as a password. And even Satoshi Nakamato as a password for a wallet account. Bit coin is based on binary , recursion math and a some black magic lattuice box secrets. (At the moment I have 45+ unused empty coin address impossible to find with brute force methods. Let me be clear I do not hold 1 million bit coin , I hold the central bank of bitcoin with 1 to 2 million addresses. I am being abatray here but I do know roughtly the exact amount , the 1st singed bitcoin was to test if information could be encrypted and stay encypted. I am intending to return soon to the world to give solutions to cyber security fields. If dumped the keys the value of bitcoin goes down, if I sign a world wide piece of paper saying I will never disclouse these keys for the 10% of the value I supposedly have as a one time payment for my work , I can then ethically start other chapters of my life .. cause in retrospect by signing the paper I am causing scarity and doing the opposite is destablisation which means 10% is a fair value for my work and creation of crypto currency. As the 10% will basically be free money cause bitcoin and cypto currencys will practically double , because the certainty of these coins becomes forever locked assets 100% guratteed.  - then edited to add my lecturer key  as proof 1."

      "The two FED governors who dissented on the decision to keep interest rates steady should be bigger news here. This is the first time in over 30 years two committee members opposed a decision. No surprise that these were two Trump appointed governors, which matters and here's why. The reason the dollar is the US's biggest export is its stability and insulation from politics because of the FED's structure which was explicitely designed to remain as insulated from politics as possible. Nothing's perfect and a few times here or there there has been some minor drama but by and large for over 110 years the Federal Reserve has maintained that goal.\n\nThere is no putting the toothpaste back in this tube as far as the dollar's standing on the world financial stage is concerned. The world has no seen how fragile the American institution actually is. Trump has managed to politicize every facet of the inner workings and now we have two political plants vying for Trump's favor in the FED, one of whom is open about wanting Jerome's position when his term ends. Trump has shown that the emporer is naked and confidence is declining, our credit rating, our respect everything that has made us what we are is slipping away. \n\nThis isn't some blue haired libtard's ranting, I hate how Trump politicized even this space, Bitcoiners who praised the subtle genious of Satoshi's open source code have become rabid over this clown because they think he's gonna pump their bags while shitting on the original premise of Bitcoin in the first place. Trump is your savior in a way because I truly believe he will fuck us all short term after he's done shitting all over us for personal gain, maybe a few of us will profit in the next 6 months or year. If you are reading this, I hope you're one of them. I hope I am too.  After that though, the bottom will drop, the bear will come and the wash out will be brutal as it always is... But after that? There will be no other option than Bitcoin. The dollar will be proper fucked, Bitcoin is the perfect store of value, it will be the world standard. Not because of a politician or group of tech bros shilling it, it simply just is what it is....\n\n At least that is what I think and I'm a fucking idiot who barely graduated high school, so we'll just see I guess"

Best thing you can do for now is learn as much as you can,follow the market,play around with wallets, try out testnets.When you\u2019re older,you\u2019ll be way ahead of the game. \ud83d\ude42"
