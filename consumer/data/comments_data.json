However, my knowledge about crypto is almost zero.\n\nI don\u2019t have a proper mentor or a clear guideline. I have tried to learn from different places, especially YouTube, but I haven\u2019t found anything that truly helps me understand things well.\n\nSo, I\u2019m reaching out to those of you who have been involved in crypto for many years and are investing regularly. I would like to learn from your experience about everything an investor should know\u2014what steps to take, what skills are important, and how to start from zero.\n\nI hope you can guide me in the right direction.

      "I've had a few. Just keep in mind that they work for you rather than the other way around. They are there to give you advice but you are still in control over the decisions with your money. You can tell them how much you want allocated toward Bitcoin and how much you give them discretion toward other things.\n\nHowever, I would consider looking into getting a fiduciary. They are much less biased because they are supposed to do what is in your best interest instead of what is in their best interest. The two things are often not the same. Whole lot of financial advisors. Will try to convince you into some life insurance scam that really isn't in your best interest, but it pays them the most so they're going to tell you to do it or give you a narrative and try to make you believe that it's in your best interest. If fiduciary usually won't do that because they are paid a flat fee regardless of what you do and won't make more money by trying to convince you to do things that aren't in your best interest but will make them more money. Truth is you can't really trust a lot of financial advisors. They'll see your Bitcoin and think, man if I could just get him to put that into something I make a percentage on, I could be making a ton more money. And so they will continually hound you to put that total balance towards something else that isn't in your best interest. A Fiduciary might also try to convince you to put your Bitcoin towards something else, thinking that it's too volatile and may not be in your best interest to have so much money and a volatile asset, but at least their suggestion comes from a place of honesty and concern over what's in your best interest. You can still disagree with them and tell them you want to keep a larger share in Bitcoin or whatever for a long-term. Just explain to them you're long-term vision and say hey. I know it's volatile. I know there's going to be times where it dips really hard in a bear market, but I believe that over the long term it's going to go up a lot more dramatically than most other things, so I accept that. It's riskier and I won't blame you for anything that happens with the Bitcoin. And they'll feel fine about it as long as they have shared with you their concerns and that you understand the risks. And they'll even often support you in your decision that you make based on understanding and information. \n\nBut whether you have a normal financial advisor who's biased and self-interested or a fiduciary who's a lot less biased, you still get to choose to do whatever you want with your money. You can tell them you want to keep a certain amount there and they can play with a different amount. If you do have somebody who is not a fiduciary and makes extra money off of selling you to do things that aren't necessarily in your best interest but pays them more money, I would make them justify any of their decisions. Then tell them you'll think about it and look into it, go run it into an AI and ask the AI about everything they said and to potentially counter against it with different advice or explain whether or not they're likely suggesting it cuz they make more money off it or whether it's really in your best interest. I just wouldn't leave it all up to trusting them when they have a conflict of interest in what you do and what they suggest to you. The easy solution is to get a fiduciary who has no conflict of interest, or at least is less likely to have a bad conflict of interest."

Still funny to think that because of inflation the raw numbers will still work out in the end.\n\nBTC will never be 100% of wealth, I would suspect that Real-Estate will always be #1 as a global asset class by market cap.  The real interesting stuff begins when prices of these assets begin to be denominated in BTC rather than USD.\n\nMaking bold claims from such broadly measured categories is kind of meaningless though, business can own real-estate, and BTC so if you measure equities are you measuring that or the underlying real-estate? And then what about derivatives? Do you count them or not? Currency? BTC backed loans to purchase property?  At some point it gets pointless because they all are representations of the other types."

      "One of the biggest things I've been thinking about is how a truly deflationary currency could change the world. We're conditioned to think deflation means catastrophe, but if everyone used the same store of value with a fixed supply, the deflationary benefits of technology's increases in productivity would be spread equally to all of society. Everyone would constantly be getting richer in equal proportion to increases in productivity over time. \n\nSome postulate this would collapse the economy because all rational consumers would save in perpetuity, but I'm not so sure. If you had confidence that your savings would only grow in purchasing power over time while still being paid a salary, I think many people would be incentivized to spend. Another interesting benefit is that it would be the default for wages to outpace profits rather than underperform them because companies would explicitly have to decrease wages in line with deflation over time - which people would be much less willing to accept compared to the subtle malevolent decrease in purchasing power that comes with a stable salary that's not keeping pace with inflation. Even if we did accept salary decreases outright, I think the psychological effect would be such that people would inherently accept smaller decreases than they do now trailing inflation."

      "I don't think it's get rich, it's not get poor.  If you have your worth/value in fiat (dollars) - you look at them as ice cubes.  Now these ice cubes are starting to melt slowly (dollar is losing worth/value through inflation and over printing of money).  So what do you?  What lot of people are doing is simply selling their ice and using that to buy something else that doesn't melt and holds its value.  Let's say you sold all your ice and bought hay (you convert your dollar stash to BTC).  Now you have that asset that isn't melting away.  Yay!    Here's the kicker, that hay you bought, there's a shortage in hay and now that hay has gone up in value and you are making money.  Now everyone wants to jump in.\n\nThe primary purpose of Bitcoin right now is to convert your melting cash into a non-melting asset (aka BTC, Gold, real estate, etc...).   That is it.  Bitcoin is that lifeboat for lots of people who are holding cash and seeing its purchasing value melt away.   Now, everyone is doing this to a limited asset and so this is why the price is going up - because the demand is going up and there is a limited supply.  This is Economics 101.\n\nPeople will always want to jump on anything that is trending that is making money.  Why not!?  I have no problem with this.  The speculation part is applying Economic math equations to the current market.  Lots of demand, not a lot of BTC means price is going to go up.  That reality is that Bitcoin and Crypto are the only markets where someone can invest and make substantial gains.  You can't do that in the bond market, stock market, saving market - there just isn't anything available for the little man to participate in and make money."

I did also reach out to them when I first found my account but I never heard back so I'm not sure what's going on there.\n\nI will say that they do take their time responding to tickets. I went back and forth with them for like 2-3 weeks because their verification system just didnt work. If you get quick replies I would consider yourself lucky. Could also look into hiring a lawyer if they don't end up letting you withdraw it. If its a decent amount it would be worth it as Bitcoin is going to $1 million in the future."

You are protesting against old fat  bald men sitting around a table diluting your savings, time and labor with the click of a button. You are protesting against the conflict of interest that exists amongst the world (ie. the head of the reserve bank benefits from QE as they hold equities and property). You are protesting against war. You are protesting against quality of food losing quality in the name of profit. You are protesting against organisations putting profit above our own health (ie rushing COVID-19 vaccines). You are protesting against those in power not being treated the same as plebs (ie Epstein files). You are protesting against your savings losing value year on year which is even more unbearable when you dont have much meaningful amounts of money to invest. You are protesting against rampart inflation that impacts the middle class and poor the most. You are protesting against self-serving mentality that is rampant throughout the world at the expense of the fellow man and woman. \n\nThe money is dirty. Some have access to cheat codes whereas others do not. \n\nI use a good analogy with friends. At the height of Counter Strike 1.6 it was amazing. Then people started to cheat and hack. Most of my friends, if not all of them, stopped playing, as it simply was not fair, and you just can't beat a team with hackers."

Some of my other investments are also long-term plays, but some are more short to medium term like 2-10 year time horizons. I skim off profits on average about every 3 years and then rotate those profits into Bitcoin for the long term. I have definitely held multiple stocks that I've been able to outpace Bitcoin in the short to medium term. The strategy has worked out well for me and if the goal is to ultimately stack as much Bitcoin as possible, I can do that more efficiently by investing in things besides just Bitcoin. \n\nSo as it stands my retirement is secured in a few different ways. I should be able to retire on my Bitcoin holdings alone. Then I should also be able to retire on my 403b investment alone. Lastly, I should be able to retire on my brokerage investments alone. If all three pan out then I'm more than set and not only am retiring but retiring early and decently wealthy. If one or more break down then I still have the contingency of having the others to secure my retirement. It helps me sleep at night knowing I'm good either way."

But I don't recommend you to use a software wallet on your computer to store your bitcoin unless you have very good computer security habits.\n\nIf you do not have very good computer security habits, then I highly recommend you to use a hardware wallet to store your bitcoin instead of a software wallet. Some good hardware wallet options are the Coldcard Q, BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition, Blockstream Jade Plus, Trezor Safe 5 with Bitcoin-only firmware, Foundation Passport Core, and SeedSigner. These six hardware wallets are all good hardware wallets that have publicly available source code that can be reviewed.\n\nI personally don't mess with ETH based on principle and because I'm not interested in a cryptocurrency that is centralized or that had a premine, and ETH is both centralized and had a large premine, but I guess I would recommend you to use the normal Trezor Safe 5 or normal BitBox02 to store it.

The price didn\u2019t move because the four people who owned the supply were probably not looking at the chart and never transacted. \n\nAs far as the BCH goldfinger attack, I was intentionally vague because even though the chain was defended, as I recall, it wasn\u2019t a full scale attack. More of a budget attack probably from Blockstream. I\u2019d say the USG tried it I\u2019m not as sure the miners would be able to defend the chain as easily.  With the ratio being positive for a substantial period for the first time one could expect another goldfinger attack on the horizon. \n\nAs far as your CME anecdote, I\u2019m not seeing the direct connection. Not to say there isn\u2019t. The congruence, to me at least, isn\u2019t obviously apparent. I can be a bit dense at times though."

Unlike a typical software feature or bug fix, the BCH fork was not implemented through a pull request (PR) in the main Bitcoin Core repository (github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

Here\u2019s why: \n\nWhat Stands Out \n\nRepetitive mentions of the same token ($WHITENET / $WHITE) across multiple, unrelated subreddits (r/AllCryptoBets, r/memecoins, r/solana, r/btc, r/CryptoPeople, etc.). This is a hallmark of a coordinated promotion effort. \n\nDirect investment enticements: \n\n\u201cBuy now before it goes public\u201d \n\n\u201cBest entries happen before the masses show up\u201d \n\n\u201cPotential upside is insane\u201d \n\n\u201cCheck it out at whiterock.fi\u201d (with repeated links to the same site) \n\nThose are calls to action encouraging purchase/investment. \n\nHype & FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) tactics: \n\n\u201cGenerational plays are made\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can already sense the momentum building\u201d \n\n\u201cInstitutional backing\u201d and \u201clong-term believers\u201d language \n\nThis is persuasive advertising language, not neutral discussion. \n\nLink dropping: Direct links to the project site (\u201cwhiterock.fi\u201d, \u201cnetwork.whiterock.fi/contribute?code=SHE\u201d) appear over and over. This moves it firmly into advertising/solicitation territory. \n\nHow Different Groups Should View This \n\nReddit Mods \n\nAlmost all of these posts violate subreddit rules on self-promotion, spam, and shilling. \n\nThey should see this as coordinated marketing, not genuine contribution. Likely to be mass-removed and the account banned. \n\nRegulators (SEC, FCA, ASIC, etc.) \n\nBecause these posts encourage investment and contain links to a contribution page, they could count as financial promotions. \n\nIf the poster is affiliated with the project (developer, team member, or paid promoter), regulators would expect full disclosure. \n\n\u201cNot financial advice\u201d disclaimers won\u2019t protect against liability if the intent is promotional. \n\nThe repeated emphasis on future profit (\u201cupside,\u201d \u201cearly believers,\u201d \u201cbuy before public launch\u201d) may be interpreted as investment solicitation \u2014 which in many jurisdictions requires licensing or approval. \n\nBottom Line \n\nThis is not innocent commenting.\nIt\u2019s a clear case of enticing buyers through promotional posting across multiple Reddit pages. \n\nIt looks like a shilling campaign designed to build hype and attract investment."

      "For a regular Solana user, the introduction of p-token could mean several practical benefits, depending on how it plays out. Here's a breakdown in simple terms:\n\n1. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: P-token is designed to cut compute usage by about 95% for the token program, which handles most transactions on Solana (like sending SOL or other tokens). This could lead to lower transaction fees and quicker processing times, making it cheaper and smoother to use apps, trade tokens, or move money on the network.\n2. Improved Experience: With less strain on the network, you might notice fewer delays or glitches, especially during busy times. Solana has had outages in the past, and this upgrade could help make it more reliable for everyday use, like buying NFTs or staking SOL.\n3. Potential Delays Before Benefits: Right now, the process is stuck on audits and validator approval (SIMD-266). This could take weeks or months, so you won\u2019t see these improvements immediately. \n4. No Direct Action Needed: As a user, you likely won\u2019t need to do anything special\u2014wallets and apps should update automatically once p-token is live. Just keep an eye on announcements from Solana or your wallet provider."

      "I guess you know rugcheck.xyz. This site gives a good overview of potential risks. \n\nThe biggest pain point probably is being able to keep tracking everything without spending loads of money when starting with a small budget.\n\nYou can start tracking new tokens for free when using multiple providers that offer free rpc nodes and just push everything into questdb, for example. You can also do a lot of checks that are done by rugcheck yourself with the data of those free nodes. You'll quickly get a blacklist for creators of rugged tokens and so on. That's not the problem. But keeping up with the prices for new tokens definitely is when using free APIs as the list of active tokens grows.\n\nLong story short, if you're not able to pay hundreds per month, you can still easily collect a lot of interesting data, but it's hard to keep track of the token prices after some time. This specifically makes backtesting not totally impossible but definitely hard and somehow limited. As the data collection grows, you're potentially able to extend the rules to mark tokens as rugged or not interesting early, but at least for me, it's a slow process."

But only if demand still meets the capacity.\n\nIf you have 1000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 100 tx, you get a fee market for these 100 tx and the highest paying 100 tx from the pool of 1000 make the cut. \n\nIf you have 8000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 10000 tx, **everyone** pays **nothing**. 8000 x 0 = 0. And that's bad design in my opinion, because it means the possible 5000 of the 8000 tx which are uneconomical pointless spam are included too. It also leads to any capacity always eventually filling up with spam. \n\n>I think it's more likely that we'll see novel uses once there is much higher capacity.\n\nYeah, I dunno, that's the \"overestimate growth based on faith and hopium\" part I mentioned. Sure you can hope for new use cases, but that's betting on black swans. The network shouldn't work like that, it should not keep lowering fees while scaling blindly, assuming future usecases popping up to save the day."

      "> truth\n\nIf you *actually* believe the things you said, maybe it's worth correcting you?\n\n> And Vitalik can fork the code at will\n\nThe truth is that *anyone* can fork the code at will. Anyone can make a copy of the client code, make a few changes, and compile and run the new code. That's easy. Trivial even.\n\nThe hard part is convincing everyone else on the network to run the new code. Unless everyone else runs the same code as you, then any transactions you make will not be seen by everyone else, and your transactions will be inconsequential and ignored. Basically, running forked code by yourself means that you have created a new network that nobody cares about and has no value.\n\nThe thing Vitalik is really good at is *convincing other people* to run new code. He does this with a combination of being *smart*, *trustworthy*, and *eloquent*. He has good ideas with pretty high consistency, and he also listens well to other developers and adopts their ideas (with attribution, of course), and he does an unusually good job of explaining those ideas in blog posts and whatnot in a fashion that Ethereum aficionados are able to understand and appreciate. And he is trustworty in that he has never proposed rule changes that would be self-serving, or motivated by anything other than the desire for Ethereum to succeed. If he did, then he would lose respect and people would stop running his code.\n\nThis happened once, actually. With the DAO fork, not everyone was convinced that undoing the hack was a good idea. Only about 85% supported reverting the hack, and 15% chose to stick to Ethereum Classic instead. The Ethereum developers (including Vitalik) can't force anyone to run new, forked code. They can only propose it. The users are the ones who ultimately choose what code Ethereum runs on."

Leo believes that most of the bull cases for ETH miss the point: the real reasons to stay convicted on ETH are both simpler and more powerful.\n\nJT and Leo will be talking about:\n\n* ETH narratives and what makes ETH worth holding when narratives shift\n* Whether ETH should be thought of as money, tech stock, or something else entirely\n* How real users and real utility show up in the bull case. \n\nWatch live on Friday, August 22 at 2pm EST on the EVMavericks Discord, YouTube and X!\n\n[https://discord.gg/evmavericks](https://discord.gg/evmavericks)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks/streams](https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks/streams)  \n[https://x.com/EVMavericks](https://x.com/EVMavericks)\n\nOr watch on demand on a long list of popular channels; you can get the full list (and upcoming guests) on Hanniabu's website: [https://dailydoots.com/podcast/](https://dailydoots.com/podcast/)"

No intention in trashing the coin. Everything else in the top 10 broke their all time high already. After almost 3 years in doge, I'm just getting tired. It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't hold from 40 cents and traded the swings instead of waiting for blast off. Just started learning TA this year."

He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"

Many in the crypto industry agreed, noting that most early investors either sold too soon, lost access to wallets, or spent their Bitcoin.

Traditionally, Bitcoin's price would peak post-halving, followed by a significant crash, but recent trends show deviations. Analysts suggest the cycle's predictability is diminishing, with reduced volatility and institutional investments stabilizing the market. Experts believe the era of 70-80% crashes may be over, replaced by milder corrections of 30-50%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

      "Back in June, I kept receiving email and in-app notifications about how my web3 wallet funds in coinbase's then \"Wallet\" app needs to be moved into my main Coinbase balance due to upcoming upgrade. So I **followed the prompt in the Coinbase app to copy the address**, and sent over my eth (~0.4 eth) from my wallet in the then \u201cwallet\u201d app into \u201cCoinbase\u201d app. This transaction happened on July 3rd, and I confirmed it after* seeing balance appear in my main Coinbase app*, within the same week I came back to the app numerous times and saw balance each time i visited. I then forgot about i, since I don't really actively trade.\n\nThen fast forward to today, randomly i decide to check on the app with ETH going up and saw my balance is now showing 0. The source of the issue is that coinbase generates an address for transactions but the recipient address generated by Coinbase earlier is now for some reasons no longer tied to my account, and I can see on eth scanner that the same amount of eth is sitting in the same address, untouched.\n\nI then contacted Coinbase support, and was given some **very fishy** response: (**Case #24184256**):\n\n* First I was told that the reason why I am not seeing it is because of delay, as the \"transaction needs enough confirmation on the blockchain to be completed\". I responded that (1) there is no way an eth transfer takes more than 40 days to complete, (2) I already saw the balance in my Coinbase app before and (3) the transaction status is marked completed 39 days ago\n* After I pushed back, the agent responded by saying actually unfortunately the address is not tied to my account, I responded that this address is generated in Coinbase app and I clearly saw the balance before.\n* Then after 10 minutes, she said she \u201cchecked with the team\u201d and the address is actually still associated with my account, and it\u2019s just not visible for some reasons. I should just \u201cplease trust them I will receive the fund and I should just wait\u201d (after 40 days?)\n* I pushed back by saying I need an explanation as to why funds can just disappear from my account and addresses can just disconnect randomly, and an ETA on when this will be restored, i was then never given a response. Another agent then jumped in, I repeated the explanation but as she was investigating why this address got disconnected with my account, she promised she\u2019s getting an update, but suddenly force closed my case after 20 mins.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as I start to push back on the first agent, on help.coinbase.com/en page whenever the agent is active I kept getting forced logged out - every time a message pops up that requires me to respond, my response will be failed to sent and upon refresh it would show that I am logged out for some reasons. And while I was gone, the agent would ask many times whether I am still connected, as if she would like to see me disconnected to be able to close the case; when this was transitioned to a new agent, the issue disappeared.\n\nSince my case was force closed, I started another case #24185822, and was essentially given the same merry-go-around, oddly, the agent also disconnected while promising me she's looking into why this address got unlinked. And the subsequent agent was also not able to help. \n\nDue to how dodgy and inaccurate the responses were, I have two hypothesis:\n\n* **Customer Support Limitation** - the agents are either actually AI, or given too little access to tools, or under too much KPI pressure to provide actual help; i went through a total of 4 agents back to back, all of them would ask me the same type of basic questions or questions i've already answered. They were clearly outsourced and working on multiple cases at any given time. \n* **Potential Coinbase data breach / incident** - the account was generated by Coinbase, they still have fund custody in this address, there was no transaction at all on any associated accounts. If I were to guess this all points to either internal system failure - either a database system migration gone wrong or some security incident that caused them to lose address-to-account mapping for some customers, potentially tied to the whole migration associated with their wallet / base app. \n\n**Bottom line is this, before today, I did not even expect to face this type of issue with a publicly traded company I used to trust.** I was never expecting to tippy toeing on a \"legit\" platform like Coinbase, if things like this can just randomly happen without clear resolution and explanation, then their mission \u201cwe are deeply focused on solving our customers\u2019 problems with technology\u201d sounds very much like a joke and it\u2019s hard to separate them from any other smaller more suspicious exchanges. \n\nI have screenshots of all these conversations because it felt sus. Now I am out of options besides escalating this with their execs or government agencies, it absolutely sucks but I am just glad I didn't put my life savings or a larger investment on this platform, because now I sure as hell don't have the trust to do that."

The new rules include robust cold-wallet infrastructure, private key controls, third-party assessments, and 24/7 security monitoring. These standards will serve as the baseline for a future licensing regime for standalone virtual asset custodians, aiming to foster a trusted digital asset ecosystem.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

      "You are right that most blockchains either centralize to scale or push most of the work off chain, which kills the decentralization they claim to have. The difference is ICP was designed from the ground up to handle complex, compute-intensive applications on chain without offloading the core logic or state to a central authority. Its subnet architecture and orthogonal persistence let it scale while keeping the entire stack on chain and under decentralized governance. DFINITY is also actively working on roadmap milestones like Flux, Magnetosphere, and Solenoid to make ICP faster and more efficient while expanding decentralization at the same time. That is why it can run things like AI models or full web apps entirely on chain in practice, which no other major blockchain is doing."

      "BTCXAU-Chart suggests Bitcoin hasnt really approached a new ATH in adjusted terms. Of course one could also normalize for M2 supply but tbh, using the value of gold makes more sense because it better deflects on the market's perception of asset inflation.\n\nAs most of the times, BTC will take the path of most pain, which naturally is the path opposite to what most market participants expect. And the big narrative is: BTC is going to top in Q4 2025, then a bear market starts. This narrative was also present, but much more controversial in Q4 of 2021.\n\nThe longer we stay in the $110-120k area and the longer a sideway movement with low volatility, the more likely it is people lose faith and interest. This will eventually lead to a continuation of the bull market. If euphoria sets in because of stupid political shenanigans for example, a quick surge followed by a blow-off top become more likely. Altought right now, it certainly looks like the top is already in. But who cares, really? The year 2028 and especially 2032 and beyond is more more interesting."

      "The stuff you mentioned is just scratching the surface honestly. I work at an engineering consultancy and we see this convergence happening in ways most people aren't thinking about yet.  \n  \nMEV protection is getting huge. AI models can predict and counter frontrunning attacks in real time by analyzing mempool patterns and transaction flows. Our clients building DEX infrastructure are using this to protect their users from sandwich attacks and other MEV extraction.  \n  \nCross chain bridge security is another area where AI makes sense. Training models on historical bridge exploits and transaction patterns to detect when someone's trying to manipulate oracle feeds or exploit timing differences between chains. The multichain world is creating attack vectors that humans can't monitor effectively.  \n  \nAutomated market making is evolving beyond simple algorithms. AI agents that can adjust liquidity provision strategies based on market volatility, gas prices, and even social sentiment. We've built systems that can pull liquidity during high volatility periods and redeploy when conditions stabilize.  \n  \nPrivacy preserving AI inference on blockchain data is interesting too. Using zero knowledge proofs to run AI models on encrypted transaction data without revealing the underlying information. Useful for compliance monitoring where you need to detect patterns but can't expose actual transaction details.  \n  \nDecentralized compute for AI training is getting traction. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers, distributing model training across blockchain networks. The incentive structures work well and it's more censorship resistant than traditional approaches.  \n  \nThe regulatory compliance angle is massive. AI systems that can automatically generate audit trails, detect potential violations, and even submit regulatory reports based on on chain activity. Our customers in DeFi are starting to need this as regulations get clearer.  \n  \nMost teams are still thinking about AI and crypto as separate domains but the real innovation happens when you architect them together from the ground up. The composability of both technologies creates possibilities that neither can achieve alone."

I beleive your a fan of chainlink (great token by the way I hold both!) If it had 59 billion tokens its price would be roughly .40 cents per token. Xrp has a demand that is backed by extreme popularity regardless of just fundamentals. I agree that the partnerships are overblown to some degree and the lawsuit put a damper, and they are playing some catch up but also have some niches they can enter."

The \"digitizing the stock market\" is too big of a thing, even if it ends up vaporware.  It's a good story.\n\nI missed the boat on alts, I missed the boat on MSTR.  BMNR is Tom Lee's ETH treasury company and, if we're about to have any sort of mania or leg-up, I expect the story/hype/euphoria to find its way there pronto.  The dude has been shilling BTC and ETH daily on the bloomberg channels and, frankly, he's great at it.  Having made the correct bullish calls these past 6 months doesn't hurt either.\n\nI'm a story guy.  This is a good story.  It will resonate with \"the people\", so I'm in.\n\nGoing forward, I believe there will be exactly two winners in this space; BTC and ETH.  BTC because trustless, scarce digital gold.  We all know why.  ETH because it's the backbone for all the defi, stablecoins, fancy schmancy stuff that's yet to come.  All others go to zero IMO.\n\nI have never been able to reconcile the enormous supply of ETH and why it should have value; it's much more straightforward with BTC.

Then you can leverage BTC even more which will continue until hyperbitcoinization. \n\nBasically BTC up leverage ratio goes down and you can leverage up again and again up to safe leverage ratios.\n\nNot to mention as MSTR goes up it gets more passive flows from indices leading to even more capital to buy BTC via ATM and increase the base BTC even more enabling further leverage. \n\nSo 10 years of 30% CAGR in BTC and debt at an average of 8% let's them grow their assets base 22% a year. \n\nThe amount they can grow depends on how much Capital they can raise via debt. They are primarily targeting the bond market and the money market categories. 1% of 300T ie 3T to buy BTC can definitely do the job. Let's say 1M BTC is 10 years away. They buy at an average price of 500k. That's 2M more BTC over 10 years.. \nThe limiting factor will be that they can't lever up past 50%."

Even the legislative branch has passed some crypto bills on stable coins. 50% of stable coin market built on ETH.\n\n- Eth leads alt coins seasons. \n\nSeems like the perfect storm for a strong price discovery for eth and so probably alt coins too. Especially L2s on ETH.\n\nBut I'm also thinking this time is different. Fomo retail has been burned, probably twice now for coming in late and been left holding the bag for months or years. Only recovering fully very recently if they held through it all. They may not come back in the same way as before but who knows. \n\nWe're getting close to ath so nearly all eth holders are currently in profit. That's a lot of selling pressure about to hit soon as well. If eth comes down, alts are probably coming down hard too."

      ">You read articles, and take is as truth. You are weak minded. Think for yourself.\n\nIt is not an article, is me replying to someone with the same arguments you present.\n\n>Bitcoins security in the far far future ( why it's silly to call this a crisis) does spark debate within the community and has for many years. The question of what will happen when the block subsidy stops or becomes incredibly small, who will support and secure the network? As the subsidy becomes smaller, transaction fees will have to take a larger roll. There are many cases made where this could easily be the case and work out, there are cases that prove otherwise. I for one think fees can contribute enough but this is not just a black and white situation with a yes or no answer. This goes beyond you eth maxis. This answer also heavily depends on the price and adoption of Bitcoin in the far future. To say it's already failed is so incredibly naive.  \n\nTX fees are 1% of current issuance. \n\nYou understand that even if BTC reacts, it can only do what ETH has already done. It can only play catch-up. Both chains have to pay for security, pretending you can stop printing is just not possible - so your best bet is minimal viable issuance, which is to say you always pay for security, but then any time you have fees, you can offset it with burn. The fact that Ethereum already did this is why it is a better a SOV. **It does not need to change, while Bitcoin does.** \n\n**\"Having an uncertain monetary policy is not a good one\" - EXACTLY.** You even misunderstand WHY it is good - being changeable is not the problem - that is in fact optimal, as long as the social contract is that you only change the issuance DOWN, i.e. make the monetary policy BETTER. \n\nOn top of that, even if it changes, as I have already said, POW requires more subsidy; you have to pay electricity and hardware costs of miners, or they won't mine. This is much less capitally efficient than POS - it is both less secure and less scarce than Ethereum is, and that will forever be the case.\n\nYou've been lied to, DYOR."

      "It is quite simple. Now we have stablecoins like EUROC that are provided by circle. The problem is that the prpmise of value (that the EUROC is worth exactly one euro) depends solely on Circle. If they go down or they do something shady or they have some problems the EUROC might lose its peg.\n\nWhat digital Euro has to offer is that it won't be pegged to 1 Euro. It will be 1 Euro. Whatever happens it will be worth 1 Euro by law. Just like cash - whatever happens on the world your 5 Euro bill will be worth 5 Euro\n\nSo as I understand it for now the biggest advantage is the stability and peace of mind.\n\nAlso a lot of people talk about the privacy and freedom concerns. Those are valid points but on the other hand we now have Circle that controls everything that is happening with your USDC and EUROC. They can (and I am sure they do) track how you use your coins and block some actions that they don't like. So to be honest I might even prefer ECB over some private company when it comes to who can control my money"

Supply and demand.  Supply economics are complicated in crypto because it's highly fragmented, but it's a critical metric.  The MAIN reason BTC is so expensive is because of its scarcity.  ETH has numerous variables that affect supply economics: ETH locked in Staking, lost ETH, and, of course, ETH holders.  How much supply is in exchanges/OTC exchanges is what determines price. \n\nIf ETH hits $1 trillion market cap it will be over $8k.  Is this doable?  Sure seems like it, but sell pressure on ETH goes up with the price, bag holders take profits.  Don't expect a parabolic move in a short time period, but a $1 trillion market cap is very possible."

This design preserves safety under validator churn and partial network faults while maintaining sub-second deterministic finality in optimal network conditions.\n\n\u2022\tScalability Architecture: Employs parallelized transaction execution with ordered commit protocols, allowing disjoint transaction sets to be processed concurrently while retaining a unified global state root. Avoids traditional sharding pitfalls such as cross-shard messaging complexity or security dilution.\n\n\u2022\tAnchor Subsystem: Anchors are protocol-level primitives that perform asset custody, off-chain verification, and on-chain token issuance/redemption. Asset state is cryptographically bound to custody attestations, enabling provable 1:1 backing for RWAs and fiat representations.\n\n\u2022\tCompliance Integration: Identity attestations and rule sets for KYC, AML, and FATF Travel Rule compliance are enforced at the transaction layer, ensuring that all protocol interactions can meet jurisdictional regulatory requirements without third-party middleware.\n\n\u2022\tInteroperability Layer: Native cross-chain messaging and settlement pathways allow anchors and participants to bridge assets between Keeta and external L1/L2 ecosystems, providing interoperability without external bridge contracts as single points of failure.\n\n\u2022\tTokenomics & Supply Mechanics: $KTA features deterministic emission schedules with programmed supply compression events, creating periodic liquidity constraints (\u201csupply shocks\u201d) that can amplify demand pressures in adoption phases."

      "To the best of my knowledge, HOME works differently from most crypto. Instead of following the ups and downs of Bitcoin or Ethereum, its value comes from a bunch of real-world mortgages. It\u2019s essentially like a REIT (real estate investment trust) version of crypto, moving more like slow, steady housing debt than the highly volatile crypto market.\n\nThe risk is you are trusting a small team to manage those mortgages, collect payments, and handle any defaults. If the housing market tanks, people stop paying, or the loans are not as solid as advertised, the backing for the token takes a hit. It is kind of like a mini version of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from the 2008 crash. Back then, bad or risky loans were bundled together, sold as safe, and when the housing market went south, the whole thing collapsed.\n\nThe mortgages are tied to the cryptocurrency through the protocol\u2019s structure. When investors buy HOME with stablecoins like USDC, that money is used to fund or refinance real-world home loans. Those loans are secured by liens, which are legal claims on the properties. The details of those liens and the cash flow from mortgage payments are managed on a blockchain.\n\nIn short, each token represents a share of a pool of mortgages, and the blockchain serves as the ledger that tracks ownership and payouts. As long as the underlying mortgages remain solid and the housing market stays stable, the structure can work as intended."

Then you study basic SMC concepts,  not because this will secretly make you profitable,  but so you know what everyone else is looking for/looking at.\n\nAfter that you will study ema crossovers and do some back testing and just a lot of watching. Trade only with small leverage and small margin until you have atleast 2 green weeks.\n\nAfter that you refine,  and scale and refine and scale.\n\nIf you are focused on investing or investing AND trading you also need to learn what news to follow and how global financial market influences risk."

Also just look online for the 4 year cycle, no one really is sure itll always happen but its good to read about it, basically its the idea of capital rotating from BTC to ETH to smaller and snaller cap coins.

Do not sell the dips. Timing the market is impossible. People that say that they can are lying. Markets are level 2 chaos systems. Predictions change the outcome.\n\nNext learn about what a clearing house is. That is what a blockchain solves in a decentralized manner. Once you understand that you will see clearly as to why bitcoin is going to be taking over.\n\nNext learn about private keys, how to store them securely. If you get 3x more than a hardware wallet is worth, get one. Because soon that 3x number is going to turn into a 100x number.\n\n  \nThen understand the data structure of bitcoin. Why sha256 is secure and why proof of work works.\n\nThen learn why bitcoin is a protocol and why the world only needs one blockchain. Just like the world needs one internet.\n\nThen you will sleep soundly.\n\nGetting into bitcoin requires you to learn a few skills, but anyone can get into the basics.\n\nAvoid the pump and dump schemes.
