I've been creating industrial automation for 15 plus years, labor is not as valuable as you may think. Engineering and automation can greatly reduce or even eliminate labor in most cases. The skilled labor that goes into it is not as intensive and not fulfilling to all people's purpose, so we must think bigger. \nSome of us will labor even though we don't need to cause we want to but not laboring and being consistent and dedicated can be just as prosperous in life and with that we should rejoice. The shackles are removed and we are truly free. Have zero fear and go out and live your best life cause that's all that matters. Do what you love, cause nothing else matters."

      "Quite similar. Even more similar to leveraging your stock value. The key is that bitcoin is a finite monetary asset with all the properties of a hard money like gold, but better/faster/stronger. Because the dollar will continue to be printed over time, bitcoin will naturally appreciate against the dollar\u2019s debasement. \n\nThis means your loan\u2019s liability reduces as Bitcoin appreciates. Check out this example to see how powerful this concept is:\n\u2014\u2014-\nIf you take a $30,000 Bitcoin collateral loan with $100,000 in Bitcoin as collateral (at a Bitcoin price of $100,000), resulting in a 30% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, what would the new LTV be for each 1x multiple increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from the initial loan position?\n\nStarting LTV: 30% ($30,000 loan / $100,000 Bitcoin value).\n\nFor each 1x multiple in Bitcoin price (e.g., $100,000 to $200,000):\n\t\u2022\tLoan remains $30,000.\n\t\u2022\tNew LTV = $30,000 / (new Bitcoin value).\n\nCalculations:\n\t\u2022\t1x (BTC collateral value $200,000): $30,000 / $200,000 = 15%.\n\t\u2022\t2x (BTC collateral value $300,000): $30,000 / $300,000 = 10%.\n\t\u2022\t3x (BTC collateral value $400,000): $30,000 / $400,000 = 7.5%.\n\t\u2022\t4x (BTC collateral value $500,000): $30,000 / $500,000 = 6%.\n\nEach 1x multiple greatly improves your loan\u2019s health as the LTV reduces from the appreciation, as the loan\u2019s dollar value stays fixed while collateral value increases.\n\nLike Michael Saylor says in the clip, this allows you to open a new loan and get out more funds to bring the loan to value back to where you like to keep it, 30% or 20%, whatever is comfortable for you."

I\u2019m very interested in investing in cryptocurrency. My plan is to invest $25 every week for the next 3\u20134 years consistently. However, my knowledge about crypto is almost zero.\n\nI don\u2019t have a proper mentor or a clear guideline. I have tried to learn from different places, especially YouTube, but I haven\u2019t found anything that truly helps me understand things well.\n\nSo, I\u2019m reaching out to those of you who have been involved in crypto for many years and are investing regularly. I would like to learn from your experience about everything an investor should know\u2014what steps to take, what skills are important, and how to start from zero.\n\nI hope you can guide me in the right direction.

      "I've had a few. Just keep in mind that they work for you rather than the other way around. They are there to give you advice but you are still in control over the decisions with your money. You can tell them how much you want allocated toward Bitcoin and how much you give them discretion toward other things.\n\nHowever, I would consider looking into getting a fiduciary. They are much less biased because they are supposed to do what is in your best interest instead of what is in their best interest. The two things are often not the same. Whole lot of financial advisors. Will try to convince you into some life insurance scam that really isn't in your best interest, but it pays them the most so they're going to tell you to do it or give you a narrative and try to make you believe that it's in your best interest. If fiduciary usually won't do that because they are paid a flat fee regardless of what you do and won't make more money by trying to convince you to do things that aren't in your best interest but will make them more money. Truth is you can't really trust a lot of financial advisors. They'll see your Bitcoin and think, man if I could just get him to put that into something I make a percentage on, I could be making a ton more money. And so they will continually hound you to put that total balance towards something else that isn't in your best interest. A Fiduciary might also try to convince you to put your Bitcoin towards something else, thinking that it's too volatile and may not be in your best interest to have so much money and a volatile asset, but at least their suggestion comes from a place of honesty and concern over what's in your best interest. You can still disagree with them and tell them you want to keep a larger share in Bitcoin or whatever for a long-term. Just explain to them you're long-term vision and say hey. I know it's volatile. I know there's going to be times where it dips really hard in a bear market, but I believe that over the long term it's going to go up a lot more dramatically than most other things, so I accept that. It's riskier and I won't blame you for anything that happens with the Bitcoin. And they'll feel fine about it as long as they have shared with you their concerns and that you understand the risks. And they'll even often support you in your decision that you make based on understanding and information. \n\nBut whether you have a normal financial advisor who's biased and self-interested or a fiduciary who's a lot less biased, you still get to choose to do whatever you want with your money. You can tell them you want to keep a certain amount there and they can play with a different amount. If you do have somebody who is not a fiduciary and makes extra money off of selling you to do things that aren't necessarily in your best interest but pays them more money, I would make them justify any of their decisions. Then tell them you'll think about it and look into it, go run it into an AI and ask the AI about everything they said and to potentially counter against it with different advice or explain whether or not they're likely suggesting it cuz they make more money off it or whether it's really in your best interest. I just wouldn't leave it all up to trusting them when they have a conflict of interest in what you do and what they suggest to you. The easy solution is to get a fiduciary who has no conflict of interest, or at least is less likely to have a bad conflict of interest."

Still funny to think that because of inflation the raw numbers will still work out in the end.\n\nBTC will never be 100% of wealth, I would suspect that Real-Estate will always be #1 as a global asset class by market cap.  The real interesting stuff begins when prices of these assets begin to be denominated in BTC rather than USD.\n\nMaking bold claims from such broadly measured categories is kind of meaningless though, business can own real-estate, and BTC so if you measure equities are you measuring that or the underlying real-estate? And then what about derivatives? Do you count them or not? Currency? BTC backed loans to purchase property?  At some point it gets pointless because they all are representations of the other types."

      "One of the biggest things I've been thinking about is how a truly deflationary currency could change the world. We're conditioned to think deflation means catastrophe, but if everyone used the same store of value with a fixed supply, the deflationary benefits of technology's increases in productivity would be spread equally to all of society. Everyone would constantly be getting richer in equal proportion to increases in productivity over time. \n\nSome postulate this would collapse the economy because all rational consumers would save in perpetuity, but I'm not so sure. If you had confidence that your savings would only grow in purchasing power over time while still being paid a salary, I think many people would be incentivized to spend. Another interesting benefit is that it would be the default for wages to outpace profits rather than underperform them because companies would explicitly have to decrease wages in line with deflation over time - which people would be much less willing to accept compared to the subtle malevolent decrease in purchasing power that comes with a stable salary that's not keeping pace with inflation. Even if we did accept salary decreases outright, I think the psychological effect would be such that people would inherently accept smaller decreases than they do now trailing inflation."

And if you run your own LN node you risk losing money forever from data corruption it happened before.\nUnfortunately, the 200x capital allocation brag just means Wall Street and custodians decided BTC is easier to control BCH stayed true to the original mission cheap fast censorship resistant payments for everyone without needing permission or a second layer science project."

      "Yeah, there\u2019s truth to that historical. After altseason, liquidity tends to rotate back into BTC, which is why you often see Bitcoin dominance spike after alts cool off. But it\u2019s not automatic or guaranteed every cycle; sometimes money just exits the market entirely instead of flowing back into BTC.\n\nAnd on the stock market lag, absolutely, crypto often mirrors risk-on sentiment from equities, just amplified. But unlike stocks, crypto can decouple during high-volatility events (think 2020 crash recovery or 2021 bull blow-off) because it runs on its own hype cycles too.\n\nSo yeah, ride the ride the last cycle of the 4 years, just be ready for the part where the music stops and not everything flows neatly into Bitcoin like the textbook says."

      "For a regular Solana user, the introduction of p-token could mean several practical benefits, depending on how it plays out. Here's a breakdown in simple terms:\n\n1. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: P-token is designed to cut compute usage by about 95% for the token program, which handles most transactions on Solana (like sending SOL or other tokens). This could lead to lower transaction fees and quicker processing times, making it cheaper and smoother to use apps, trade tokens, or move money on the network.\n2. Improved Experience: With less strain on the network, you might notice fewer delays or glitches, especially during busy times. Solana has had outages in the past, and this upgrade could help make it more reliable for everyday use, like buying NFTs or staking SOL.\n3. Potential Delays Before Benefits: Right now, the process is stuck on audits and validator approval (SIMD-266). This could take weeks or months, so you won\u2019t see these improvements immediately. \n4. No Direct Action Needed: As a user, you likely won\u2019t need to do anything special\u2014wallets and apps should update automatically once p-token is live. Just keep an eye on announcements from Solana or your wallet provider."

But only if demand still meets the capacity.\n\nIf you have 1000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 100 tx, you get a fee market for these 100 tx and the highest paying 100 tx from the pool of 1000 make the cut. \n\nIf you have 8000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 10000 tx, **everyone** pays **nothing**. 8000 x 0 = 0. And that's bad design in my opinion, because it means the possible 5000 of the 8000 tx which are uneconomical pointless spam are included too. It also leads to any capacity always eventually filling up with spam. \n\n>I think it's more likely that we'll see novel uses once there is much higher capacity.\n\nYeah, I dunno, that's the \"overestimate growth based on faith and hopium\" part I mentioned. Sure you can hope for new use cases, but that's betting on black swans. The network shouldn't work like that, it should not keep lowering fees while scaling blindly, assuming future usecases popping up to save the day."

      "> truth\n\nIf you *actually* believe the things you said, maybe it's worth correcting you?\n\n> And Vitalik can fork the code at will\n\nThe truth is that *anyone* can fork the code at will. Anyone can make a copy of the client code, make a few changes, and compile and run the new code. That's easy. Trivial even.\n\nThe hard part is convincing everyone else on the network to run the new code. Unless everyone else runs the same code as you, then any transactions you make will not be seen by everyone else, and your transactions will be inconsequential and ignored. Basically, running forked code by yourself means that you have created a new network that nobody cares about and has no value.\n\nThe thing Vitalik is really good at is *convincing other people* to run new code. He does this with a combination of being *smart*, *trustworthy*, and *eloquent*. He has good ideas with pretty high consistency, and he also listens well to other developers and adopts their ideas (with attribution, of course), and he does an unusually good job of explaining those ideas in blog posts and whatnot in a fashion that Ethereum aficionados are able to understand and appreciate. And he is trustworty in that he has never proposed rule changes that would be self-serving, or motivated by anything other than the desire for Ethereum to succeed. If he did, then he would lose respect and people would stop running his code.\n\nThis happened once, actually. With the DAO fork, not everyone was convinced that undoing the hack was a good idea. Only about 85% supported reverting the hack, and 15% chose to stick to Ethereum Classic instead. The Ethereum developers (including Vitalik) can't force anyone to run new, forked code. They can only propose it. The users are the ones who ultimately choose what code Ethereum runs on."

      "Bro, bonk guy is extremely legit ... *extreeeeemely legit*. I call him Uni, sometimes because i noticed many of his friends on CT did. He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"

Techdev highlighted the difficulty of maintaining 'diamond hands,' or strong risk tolerance, through Bitcoin's ups and downs. Many in the crypto industry agreed, noting that most early investors either sold too soon, lost access to wallets, or spent their Bitcoin. Holding long-term requires exceptional discipline and conviction.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

Traditionally, Bitcoin's price would peak post-halving, followed by a significant crash, but recent trends show deviations. Analysts suggest the cycle's predictability is diminishing, with reduced volatility and institutional investments stabilizing the market. Experts believe the era of 70-80% crashes may be over, replaced by milder corrections of 30-50%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

So yes, if the of USD entered hyperinflation, bitcoin price would appreciate against it because each new USD is now worth 90% less.\n\nOf course, the bitcoin price would also crash because the US is a huge percentage of the crypto market and that would be a huge loss in buying power.

      "Back in June, I kept receiving email and in-app notifications about how my web3 wallet funds in coinbase's then \"Wallet\" app needs to be moved into my main Coinbase balance due to upcoming upgrade. So I **followed the prompt in the Coinbase app to copy the address**, and sent over my eth (~0.4 eth) from my wallet in the then \u201cwallet\u201d app into \u201cCoinbase\u201d app. This transaction happened on July 3rd, and I confirmed it after* seeing balance appear in my main Coinbase app*, within the same week I came back to the app numerous times and saw balance each time i visited. I then forgot about i, since I don't really actively trade.\n\nThen fast forward to today, randomly i decide to check on the app with ETH going up and saw my balance is now showing 0. The source of the issue is that coinbase generates an address for transactions but the recipient address generated by Coinbase earlier is now for some reasons no longer tied to my account, and I can see on eth scanner that the same amount of eth is sitting in the same address, untouched.\n\nI then contacted Coinbase support, and was given some **very fishy** response: (**Case #24184256**):\n\n* First I was told that the reason why I am not seeing it is because of delay, as the \"transaction needs enough confirmation on the blockchain to be completed\". I responded that (1) there is no way an eth transfer takes more than 40 days to complete, (2) I already saw the balance in my Coinbase app before and (3) the transaction status is marked completed 39 days ago\n* After I pushed back, the agent responded by saying actually unfortunately the address is not tied to my account, I responded that this address is generated in Coinbase app and I clearly saw the balance before.\n* Then after 10 minutes, she said she \u201cchecked with the team\u201d and the address is actually still associated with my account, and it\u2019s just not visible for some reasons. I should just \u201cplease trust them I will receive the fund and I should just wait\u201d (after 40 days?)\n* I pushed back by saying I need an explanation as to why funds can just disappear from my account and addresses can just disconnect randomly, and an ETA on when this will be restored, i was then never given a response. Another agent then jumped in, I repeated the explanation but as she was investigating why this address got disconnected with my account, she promised she\u2019s getting an update, but suddenly force closed my case after 20 mins.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as I start to push back on the first agent, on help.coinbase.com/en page whenever the agent is active I kept getting forced logged out - every time a message pops up that requires me to respond, my response will be failed to sent and upon refresh it would show that I am logged out for some reasons. And while I was gone, the agent would ask many times whether I am still connected, as if she would like to see me disconnected to be able to close the case; when this was transitioned to a new agent, the issue disappeared.\n\nSince my case was force closed, I started another case #24185822, and was essentially given the same merry-go-around, oddly, the agent also disconnected while promising me she's looking into why this address got unlinked. And the subsequent agent was also not able to help. \n\nDue to how dodgy and inaccurate the responses were, I have two hypothesis:\n\n* **Customer Support Limitation** - the agents are either actually AI, or given too little access to tools, or under too much KPI pressure to provide actual help; i went through a total of 4 agents back to back, all of them would ask me the same type of basic questions or questions i've already answered. They were clearly outsourced and working on multiple cases at any given time. \n* **Potential Coinbase data breach / incident** - the account was generated by Coinbase, they still have fund custody in this address, there was no transaction at all on any associated accounts. If I were to guess this all points to either internal system failure - either a database system migration gone wrong or some security incident that caused them to lose address-to-account mapping for some customers, potentially tied to the whole migration associated with their wallet / base app. \n\n**Bottom line is this, before today, I did not even expect to face this type of issue with a publicly traded company I used to trust.** I was never expecting to tippy toeing on a \"legit\" platform like Coinbase, if things like this can just randomly happen without clear resolution and explanation, then their mission \u201cwe are deeply focused on solving our customers\u2019 problems with technology\u201d sounds very much like a joke and it\u2019s hard to separate them from any other smaller more suspicious exchanges. \n\nI have screenshots of all these conversations because it felt sus. Now I am out of options besides escalating this with their execs or government agencies, it absolutely sucks but I am just glad I didn't put my life savings or a larger investment on this platform, because now I sure as hell don't have the trust to do that."

The \"digitizing the stock market\" is too big of a thing, even if it ends up vaporware.  It's a good story.\n\nI missed the boat on alts, I missed the boat on MSTR.  BMNR is Tom Lee's ETH treasury company and, if we're about to have any sort of mania or leg-up, I expect the story/hype/euphoria to find its way there pronto.  The dude has been shilling BTC and ETH daily on the bloomberg channels and, frankly, he's great at it.  Having made the correct bullish calls these past 6 months doesn't hurt either.\n\nI'm a story guy.  This is a good story.  It will resonate with \"the people\", so I'm in.\n\nGoing forward, I believe there will be exactly two winners in this space; BTC and ETH.  BTC because trustless, scarce digital gold.  We all know why.  ETH because it's the backbone for all the defi, stablecoins, fancy schmancy stuff that's yet to come.  All others go to zero IMO.\n\nI have never been able to reconcile the enormous supply of ETH and why it should have value; it's much more straightforward with BTC.

If trump replaces the fed board with lackeys then the currency will get destroyed instead. \n\nNone of these things are good.

Then you can leverage BTC even more which will continue until hyperbitcoinization. \n\nBasically BTC up leverage ratio goes down and you can leverage up again and again up to safe leverage ratios.\n\nNot to mention as MSTR goes up it gets more passive flows from indices leading to even more capital to buy BTC via ATM and increase the base BTC even more enabling further leverage. \n\nSo 10 years of 30% CAGR in BTC and debt at an average of 8% let's them grow their assets base 22% a year. \n\nThe amount they can grow depends on how much Capital they can raise via debt. They are primarily targeting the bond market and the money market categories. 1% of 300T ie 3T to buy BTC can definitely do the job. Let's say 1M BTC is 10 years away. They buy at an average price of 500k. That's 2M more BTC over 10 years.. \nThe limiting factor will be that they can't lever up past 50%."

Especially L2s on ETH.\n\nBut I'm also thinking this time is different. Fomo retail has been burned, probably twice now for coming in late and been left holding the bag for months or years. Only recovering fully very recently if they held through it all. They may not come back in the same way as before but who knows. \n\nWe're getting close to ath so nearly all eth holders are currently in profit. That's a lot of selling pressure about to hit soon as well. If eth comes down, alts are probably coming down hard too."

      ">You read articles, and take is as truth. You are weak minded. Think for yourself.\n\nIt is not an article, is me replying to someone with the same arguments you present.\n\n>Bitcoins security in the far far future ( why it's silly to call this a crisis) does spark debate within the community and has for many years. The question of what will happen when the block subsidy stops or becomes incredibly small, who will support and secure the network? As the subsidy becomes smaller, transaction fees will have to take a larger roll. There are many cases made where this could easily be the case and work out, there are cases that prove otherwise. I for one think fees can contribute enough but this is not just a black and white situation with a yes or no answer. This goes beyond you eth maxis. This answer also heavily depends on the price and adoption of Bitcoin in the far future. To say it's already failed is so incredibly naive.  \n\nTX fees are 1% of current issuance. \n\nYou understand that even if BTC reacts, it can only do what ETH has already done. It can only play catch-up. Both chains have to pay for security, pretending you can stop printing is just not possible - so your best bet is minimal viable issuance, which is to say you always pay for security, but then any time you have fees, you can offset it with burn. The fact that Ethereum already did this is why it is a better a SOV. **It does not need to change, while Bitcoin does.** \n\n**\"Having an uncertain monetary policy is not a good one\" - EXACTLY.** You even misunderstand WHY it is good - being changeable is not the problem - that is in fact optimal, as long as the social contract is that you only change the issuance DOWN, i.e. make the monetary policy BETTER. \n\nOn top of that, even if it changes, as I have already said, POW requires more subsidy; you have to pay electricity and hardware costs of miners, or they won't mine. This is much less capitally efficient than POS - it is both less secure and less scarce than Ethereum is, and that will forever be the case.\n\nYou've been lied to, DYOR."

Supply and demand.  Supply economics are complicated in crypto because it's highly fragmented, but it's a critical metric.  The MAIN reason BTC is so expensive is because of its scarcity.  ETH has numerous variables that affect supply economics: ETH locked in Staking, lost ETH, and, of course, ETH holders.  How much supply is in exchanges/OTC exchanges is what determines price. \n\nIf ETH hits $1 trillion market cap it will be over $8k.  Is this doable?  Sure seems like it, but sell pressure on ETH goes up with the price, bag holders take profits.  Don't expect a parabolic move in a short time period, but a $1 trillion market cap is very possible."

Disclaimer: I hold Keeta, so dyor.\n\nHere is my shill:\n\nKeeta\u2019s protocol stack is designed as a compliance-native, high-throughput, Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Layer 1 optimized for regulated asset issuance and settlement.\n\n\u2022\tConsensus Layer: Implements a deterministic quorum-based BFT model requiring \u2265 2/3+1 validator voting power for block finality. This design preserves safety under validator churn and partial network faults while maintaining sub-second deterministic finality in optimal network conditions.\n\n\u2022\tScalability Architecture: Employs parallelized transaction execution with ordered commit protocols, allowing disjoint transaction sets to be processed concurrently while retaining a unified global state root. Avoids traditional sharding pitfalls such as cross-shard messaging complexity or security dilution.\n\n\u2022\tAnchor Subsystem: Anchors are protocol-level primitives that perform asset custody, off-chain verification, and on-chain token issuance/redemption. Asset state is cryptographically bound to custody attestations, enabling provable 1:1 backing for RWAs and fiat representations.\n\n\u2022\tCompliance Integration: Identity attestations and rule sets for KYC, AML, and FATF Travel Rule compliance are enforced at the transaction layer, ensuring that all protocol interactions can meet jurisdictional regulatory requirements without third-party middleware.\n\n\u2022\tInteroperability Layer: Native cross-chain messaging and settlement pathways allow anchors and participants to bridge assets between Keeta and external L1/L2 ecosystems, providing interoperability without external bridge contracts as single points of failure.\n\n\u2022\tTokenomics & Supply Mechanics: $KTA features deterministic emission schedules with programmed supply compression events, creating periodic liquidity constraints (\u201csupply shocks\u201d) that can amplify demand pressures in adoption phases."
