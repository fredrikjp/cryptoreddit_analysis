I\u2019m very interested in investing in cryptocurrency. My plan is to invest $25 every week for the next 3\u20134 years consistently. However, my knowledge about crypto is almost zero.\n\nI don\u2019t have a proper mentor or a clear guideline. I have tried to learn from different places, especially YouTube, but I haven\u2019t found anything that truly helps me understand things well.\n\nSo, I\u2019m reaching out to those of you who have been involved in crypto for many years and are investing regularly. I would like to learn from your experience about everything an investor should know\u2014what steps to take, what skills are important, and how to start from zero.\n\nI hope you can guide me in the right direction.

      "I've had a few. Just keep in mind that they work for you rather than the other way around. They are there to give you advice but you are still in control over the decisions with your money. You can tell them how much you want allocated toward Bitcoin and how much you give them discretion toward other things.\n\nHowever, I would consider looking into getting a fiduciary. They are much less biased because they are supposed to do what is in your best interest instead of what is in their best interest. The two things are often not the same. Whole lot of financial advisors. Will try to convince you into some life insurance scam that really isn't in your best interest, but it pays them the most so they're going to tell you to do it or give you a narrative and try to make you believe that it's in your best interest. If fiduciary usually won't do that because they are paid a flat fee regardless of what you do and won't make more money by trying to convince you to do things that aren't in your best interest but will make them more money. Truth is you can't really trust a lot of financial advisors. They'll see your Bitcoin and think, man if I could just get him to put that into something I make a percentage on, I could be making a ton more money. And so they will continually hound you to put that total balance towards something else that isn't in your best interest. A Fiduciary might also try to convince you to put your Bitcoin towards something else, thinking that it's too volatile and may not be in your best interest to have so much money and a volatile asset, but at least their suggestion comes from a place of honesty and concern over what's in your best interest. You can still disagree with them and tell them you want to keep a larger share in Bitcoin or whatever for a long-term. Just explain to them you're long-term vision and say hey. I know it's volatile. I know there's going to be times where it dips really hard in a bear market, but I believe that over the long term it's going to go up a lot more dramatically than most other things, so I accept that. It's riskier and I won't blame you for anything that happens with the Bitcoin. And they'll feel fine about it as long as they have shared with you their concerns and that you understand the risks. And they'll even often support you in your decision that you make based on understanding and information. \n\nBut whether you have a normal financial advisor who's biased and self-interested or a fiduciary who's a lot less biased, you still get to choose to do whatever you want with your money. You can tell them you want to keep a certain amount there and they can play with a different amount. If you do have somebody who is not a fiduciary and makes extra money off of selling you to do things that aren't necessarily in your best interest but pays them more money, I would make them justify any of their decisions. Then tell them you'll think about it and look into it, go run it into an AI and ask the AI about everything they said and to potentially counter against it with different advice or explain whether or not they're likely suggesting it cuz they make more money off it or whether it's really in your best interest. I just wouldn't leave it all up to trusting them when they have a conflict of interest in what you do and what they suggest to you. The easy solution is to get a fiduciary who has no conflict of interest, or at least is less likely to have a bad conflict of interest."

The real interesting stuff begins when prices of these assets begin to be denominated in BTC rather than USD.\n\nMaking bold claims from such broadly measured categories is kind of meaningless though, business can own real-estate, and BTC so if you measure equities are you measuring that or the underlying real-estate? And then what about derivatives? Do you count them or not? Currency? BTC backed loans to purchase property?  At some point it gets pointless because they all are representations of the other types."

      "One of the biggest things I've been thinking about is how a truly deflationary currency could change the world. We're conditioned to think deflation means catastrophe, but if everyone used the same store of value with a fixed supply, the deflationary benefits of technology's increases in productivity would be spread equally to all of society. Everyone would constantly be getting richer in equal proportion to increases in productivity over time. \n\nSome postulate this would collapse the economy because all rational consumers would save in perpetuity, but I'm not so sure. If you had confidence that your savings would only grow in purchasing power over time while still being paid a salary, I think many people would be incentivized to spend. Another interesting benefit is that it would be the default for wages to outpace profits rather than underperform them because companies would explicitly have to decrease wages in line with deflation over time - which people would be much less willing to accept compared to the subtle malevolent decrease in purchasing power that comes with a stable salary that's not keeping pace with inflation. Even if we did accept salary decreases outright, I think the psychological effect would be such that people would inherently accept smaller decreases than they do now trailing inflation."

      "I don't think it's get rich, it's not get poor.  If you have your worth/value in fiat (dollars) - you look at them as ice cubes.  Now these ice cubes are starting to melt slowly (dollar is losing worth/value through inflation and over printing of money).  So what do you?  What lot of people are doing is simply selling their ice and using that to buy something else that doesn't melt and holds its value.  Let's say you sold all your ice and bought hay (you convert your dollar stash to BTC).  Now you have that asset that isn't melting away.  Yay!    Here's the kicker, that hay you bought, there's a shortage in hay and now that hay has gone up in value and you are making money.  Now everyone wants to jump in.\n\nThe primary purpose of Bitcoin right now is to convert your melting cash into a non-melting asset (aka BTC, Gold, real estate, etc...).   That is it.  Bitcoin is that lifeboat for lots of people who are holding cash and seeing its purchasing value melt away.   Now, everyone is doing this to a limited asset and so this is why the price is going up - because the demand is going up and there is a limited supply.  This is Economics 101.\n\nPeople will always want to jump on anything that is trending that is making money.  Why not!?  I have no problem with this.  The speculation part is applying Economic math equations to the current market.  Lots of demand, not a lot of BTC means price is going to go up.  That reality is that Bitcoin and Crypto are the only markets where someone can invest and make substantial gains.  You can't do that in the bond market, stock market, saving market - there just isn't anything available for the little man to participate in and make money."

I did also reach out to them when I first found my account but I never heard back so I'm not sure what's going on there.\n\nI will say that they do take their time responding to tickets. I went back and forth with them for like 2-3 weeks because their verification system just didnt work. If you get quick replies I would consider yourself lucky. Could also look into hiring a lawyer if they don't end up letting you withdraw it. If its a decent amount it would be worth it as Bitcoin is going to $1 million in the future."

You are protesting against organisations putting profit above our own health (ie rushing COVID-19 vaccines). You are protesting against those in power not being treated the same as plebs (ie Epstein files). You are protesting against your savings losing value year on year which is even more unbearable when you dont have much meaningful amounts of money to invest. You are protesting against rampart inflation that impacts the middle class and poor the most. You are protesting against self-serving mentality that is rampant throughout the world at the expense of the fellow man and woman. \n\nThe money is dirty. Some have access to cheat codes whereas others do not. \n\nI use a good analogy with friends. At the height of Counter Strike 1.6 it was amazing. Then people started to cheat and hack. Most of my friends, if not all of them, stopped playing, as it simply was not fair, and you just can't beat a team with hackers."

Some of my other investments are also long-term plays, but some are more short to medium term like 2-10 year time horizons. I skim off profits on average about every 3 years and then rotate those profits into Bitcoin for the long term. I have definitely held multiple stocks that I've been able to outpace Bitcoin in the short to medium term. The strategy has worked out well for me and if the goal is to ultimately stack as much Bitcoin as possible, I can do that more efficiently by investing in things besides just Bitcoin. \n\nSo as it stands my retirement is secured in a few different ways. I should be able to retire on my Bitcoin holdings alone. Then I should also be able to retire on my 403b investment alone. Lastly, I should be able to retire on my brokerage investments alone. If all three pan out then I'm more than set and not only am retiring but retiring early and decently wealthy.

But I don't recommend you to use a software wallet on your computer to store your bitcoin unless you have very good computer security habits.\n\nIf you do not have very good computer security habits, then I highly recommend you to use a hardware wallet to store your bitcoin instead of a software wallet. Some good hardware wallet options are the Coldcard Q, BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition, Blockstream Jade Plus, Trezor Safe 5 with Bitcoin-only firmware, Foundation Passport Core, and SeedSigner. These six hardware wallets are all good hardware wallets that have publicly available source code that can be reviewed.\n\nI personally don't mess with ETH based on principle and because I'm not interested in a cryptocurrency that is centralized or that had a premine, and ETH is both centralized and had a large premine, but I guess I would recommend you to use the normal Trezor Safe 5 or normal BitBox02 to store it.

However as far as a break in the four-year cycle for an incoming bear market at least one that would be comparable to previous bear markets draw downs in my opinion, is a slight mystery. I say that, because although the halving cycles have not changed, nor will they\u2026 Institutional adoption, ETF inflows, bitcoin treasury companies, states/nations/funds creating reserves, 401ks/pension access, and the beginning of financial instruments that are able to tap other markets/their market caps (bond market 500T alone etc.). Have changed not only the amount of exposure that people who previously did not have the opportunity to have to bitcoin, and other crypto assets for that matter. It has also changed the amount of M2 money supply that can flow into bitcoin that previously was impossible through new legislation, and more crypto friendly environment, and more recognizable adoption by those who previously didn\u2019t understand what it even was or how to acquire it. \n\nThis is not financial advice in anyway.. I\u2019m a degenerate bitcoin maxi, with a heavy biased, who owns bitcoin, and is also irresponsibly long MSTR! The only thing I can say is you can\u2019t go wrong stacking stats, and not worrying about the short term, if you truly believe, and are in this for the long game."

      "To take a stab at a simple explanation: Bitcoin is a distributed ledger. Thousands of nodes around the world are keeping track of the ledger, that is to say the list of who owns how many bitcoin. When miners solve their \"puzzle\" they earn the right to post a new block of transactions and collect the fees attached to them. Every node then checks their work, makes sure it all follows the agreed upon rules, and then updates their copy of the ledger. No single entity is in control because there's no one master copy of the ledger, just a system for the nodes to agree upon the correct state of it.\n\n\nWhat you store as an owner of bitcoin is not the bitcoin itself, but a private key. Private key / public key cryptography is a system where you basically have two magic codes. One of them can encode a message that the other can decode. You make one of them publicly known and keep one of them secret. Then when you encode a message with the secret one, people can decode it with the public one to confirm that the message really came from you. This is how you prove ownership of and move your bitcoin, because there is a public key attached to the bitcoin on the ledger and you can mathematically prove you know the corresponding private key. Nobody can guess your private key because it's a 256 bit number, bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. You could guess a million times a second for a million years and get nowhere.\n\n\nCentralized exchanges are institutions that have order books and basically exist as middlemen to connect buyers and sellers and skim a fee / spread for their trouble. Trading does happen peer to peer as well."

Maybe some of the early contracts I created will be worth much more in the future.\n\nLike most people, I kicked myself, got back in at much higher prices, held through multiple crypto winters, and still end up negative on crypto investments (dmg from several shitcoins & associated pump and dumps). Eh, as long as you don't play with money you can't afford to lose, you're fine.\n\nSo yeah, even for people who's been involved in crypto for a while, profit is not guaranteed. Just like stocks, you have to have conviction and diamond hands. Most people aren't built for it."

They instead borrow to leverage, to do other investments, or maybe occasionally for some one off splurge, which then then recover/amortize over a period.  But NOT for living expenses on and on forever.  E.g., many rich people have mortgages on property, because they have uses for the money that yield more than the interest cost.  Or because the property then generates income higher than the interest cost.  Same with margin on stocks.  This is just leveraged investing."

      "Deflation doesn\u2019t reduce economic activity to subsistence, it removes waste. People will still spend on food, housing, healthcare, and the things they truly value. The difference is they won\u2019t be incentivized to take on reckless debt just to keep up with inflation. Innovation doesn\u2019t die under deflation, it thrives, because companies must compete on real value. Look at tech\u2026laptops, TVs, and phones have gotten cheaper and better year after year. That\u2019s natural deflation, and it expanded the market, not collapsed it.\n\nAs for authoritarianism, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to suppress alternatives. Anyone can create or use weaker currencies if they want. The difference is that nobody will voluntarily hold money that bleeds value once they have access to the hardest money ever invented. This is exactly why fiat replaced gold in practice: not because gold wasn\u2019t valuable, but because gold was inefficient to spend and settle with. It was heavy, clunky, and not easily divisible, so people accepted fiat for convenience, especially once governments forced the transition in 1933.\n\nBitcoin fixes those inefficiencies and adds every property that makes it the apex form of money. It is absolutely scarce with a hard cap of 21 million. It is infinitely divisible down to sats, which means it works for both global trade and microtransactions. It is weightless and portable, able to move anywhere in the world instantly. It is durable and indestructible so long as the network exists. It is verifiable and transparent, where every unit can be validated by anyone. It is censorship resistant, meaning no government or bank can block or seize it without your keys. It is borderless, operating the same everywhere on earth. It is decentralized, so there\u2019s no single point of failure or control. It is programmable, opening the door to innovation and new applications. And it is backed by real world energy expenditure through proof of work, anchoring it in physical reality.\n\nGold had scarcity but failed on efficiency. Fiat had efficiency but failed on trust and scarcity. Bitcoin unifies both and upgrades them, giving us money that is simultaneously scarce, secure, portable, divisible, durable, verifiable, censorship resistant, borderless, decentralized, programmable, and energy backed. That\u2019s definitely doesn\u2019t sound like authoritarianism to me, and sounds more like free market choice driving convergence toward the best form of money humanity has ever had."

That's the reason why so many get \"wrecked\" every single cycle, they typically buy in at the top thinking they will make crazy gain on some alt that heard about online. \n\nBTC specifically is well past the days where trading in and out of it is worth your time, even if you know what you are doing. This cycle we could peak at 150-180k and after a bear market bottom out around 60-80k. When you factor in things like capital gain tax this really isn't worth considering. In the 2021 and 2017 cycle I think there was definitely some merit to this though. \n\nBTC is an asset that is becoming increasingly more and more scarce. New supply to the market is rapidly decreasing and people are locking it away and holding it, as they see it as a long term asset now. Roughly .2 BTC is very solid and could do quite well in the 2030s and beyond. \n\nDo you already own this or planning on making this purchase? Regardless, buy and hold and seriously consider regularly stacking, imagine treating it like a savings account of sorts."

      "There is a lot of misleading and incomplete information on this thread. There are 2 distinct ways to support bitcoin.\n\n1. Mining Bitcoin - This is where you setup a computer to help solve the mathematical equations that create new bitcoin. The equations have become so complex that they require a very expensive computer to make it worthwhile for the average person. (Like enormously expensive computers!) This is not what this thread is discussing.\n2. Running a Bitcoin Node - This is what we are discussing on this thread. When Bitcoin is bought and sold each transaction must be verified by at least 6 computers running the Bitcoin Node software on the network. If it has not been verified by 6 computers the transaction is not considered legitimate and is not added to the ledger. There are currently tens of thousands of computers worldwide that are running the node software on the network 24 hours a day 7 days a week. A computer that is on the Bitcoin Node network can interact with as many as another 100 to 200 computers on the network at a time. This is what keeps Bitcoin decentralized and safe. If something happened to the network, all it would take is 1 computer that still contains the Bitcoin Ledger to restart the network. This is what we are talking about on this thread. How you can setup and run one of these Bitcoin Node computers. And no, you do this to keep the network safe as there is no monetary compensation for doing this. You can however set up your very own wallet on your node. This means that you store your bitcoin on your computer so that you don't have to use a service like Ledger, Trezor, Coinbase or Kraken to store it."

After he died, I needed to compile our finances, and I remembered I had an old retirement account. \n\nI found the original paperwork from the account, logged in, and found it had grown a whopping $1000 in 13 years - less than 2% a year. \n\nWhen I went to rollover the policy, I found I'd written notes from the salesman on the back of his brochures, and unlocked a totally forgotten memory!\n\nWay back in September 2011, this sketchy young libertarian salesman came to my work, selling various annuities, life insurance, 403b, etc. He explained his company's shitty products (which I bought), but then explained this outside 'opportunity,' that I could purchase separately through him. Per my notes, 'bincoy' would give me 'bmw money.' I decided to put $150/month into the 403b and $100/month into 'bincoy.'\n\nWent home and told my husband about it, who laughed at me and called me a sucker to fall for such an obvious scam. Called the guy back and asked for my $100 check back and to put it all into the 403b instead."

      "I would get some sort of exposure into BTC instead of completely sitting on the sidelines, but I wouldn't go all in or make some massive purchase either. For instance, you could buy .5 BTC, which would be less than 20% of your $ stack from your inheritance. This is a very sizeable position that few will reach but you also still have roughly $250,000 remaining. You could park this remaining money into a high yield savings account and the monthly interest could be invested into BTC. Meanwhile, you can continue to learn more about BTC before making even more major moves. \n\nIf you wanted to be a bit more aggressive though, here is my take.\n\nYou honestly could even just go in and become a whole coiner and just officially join that club and be done with it. VERY few people will ever attain this and by locking in this position you are going to be in fantastic shape. The people that talk about potential bear markets have a good point but it's not really something I'd concern myself with at this point. Realistically, if we are still going to follow a 4 year cycle we see a bear market low of 70-80k, maybe we get into the 60k range. Sure, that's quite a bit lower from here, but it's not like we are going from 60k to sub 20k or 20k to below 5k. There is way more long term potential to the upside than some down side risk of maybe 50% at the most from here, which may not even happen btw. You would still have close to 200k remaining in $ with this purchase AND have officially joined that club.\n\nThe caution I would have would be to make sure to learn about self custody, cold wallets and how to secure these funds so you don't lose them. Don't leave these funds on an exchange or just throw them on a wallet without thinking of how to secure the seed phrases."

If any of this is confusing then you have work to do to better understand how open source software works. It also explains my claim of why Satoshi coming back would have no effect on the software he created and then gave to the world. He's as free, or as limited, on what he could do with the code as the rest of us are.\n\nDecentralization. I think you may be conflating the Bitcoin protocol and network with pooled mining. Bitcoin is decentralized as a network because people from all over run the Bitcoin software, mentioned above, and they all connect to each other and enforce the rules of the protocol. When I mentioned centralization I was pointing out one major threat to Bitcoin security and censorship resistance and that is mining pool centralization. The more hashrate in control of fewer people diminishes the security of the network by giving outsized control of what transactions are included on the blockchain. It could also give them the power to reorganize the chain, censor transactions, load the chain with spam, or simply block transactions altogether.\n\nThis is what I meant though in my initial response. People out here are \"number go up\" focused and don't try to actually understand what Bitcoin is and participate in it. Bitcoin is not invincible and we all need to get involved, for our own selfish reasons, to make it robust and vibrant. You don't have to be a software developer to participate in the network and help strengthen it. We all want the number to go up but it won't if systemic issues within the project are not dealt with.\n\nRead a book: Mastering Bitcoin\nListen to a podcast: What Bitcoin Did\nUse a website: Learn Me a Bitcoin"

So is free speech, and i think long term you can't suppress these things. \n\nYour both arguing that bitcoin is a threat to the system, but also that it's really bad. If the population can't get loans and they blame bitcoin, they will stop using it and it'll fail.  \n  \nAnother aspect we haven't talked about is how the interest rate is set by the FED. If you had to go out and get a loan at market rates, it would be a lot higher because your now competing with stocks and real estate and things that appreciate in value.  \n\nI guess in a socialist leaning country you could just subsidize house loans on a bitcoin standard. Would just be through taxes instead of monetary inflation.  \n\nI'm convinced that bitcoin and fiat can't coexist. At least not long term. \n\nMaybe you'll find some signal in answers you get here, if not I would not recommend to stay here and read posts. Go to twitter or listen to some podcasts. This isn't a subject I'm particularly interest in, so I can't really recommend anyone other than the two authors.  Saifedean Ammous and Lyn alden.   \n  \nSaifedean Ammous has a podcast, he might have a some episodes on this subject."

To blow past gold would be to put Bitcoin more in a category akin to \"ALL US EQUITIES\" or something that feels more like a Goliath.\n\nAt that point it would be very difficult for anyone to say that it cannot continue going up, because it would start getting compared to much bigger asset classes, like real estate. At that point people will really consider whether or not buying a second home and earning rental income is really worth missing out on Bitcoin, especially when wealth taxes start eating into the value of real estate given that it's the only thing governments can tax and that would solve the housing crisis. You might have a political party that literally campaigns on a platform of collapsing real estate prices, in opposition to the collateral base of the banks, in favour of families and communities. Something like that is happening in London today, with real estate valuations dropping 8% per year according to some estimates. \n\nIf real estate is intentionally targeted to rake in some more taxes and solve the housing crisis (and therefore avert demographic collapse) then Bitcoin is stabilising at $30T is easy to imagine. \n\nAnd any gains from there would be pure fiat debasement, which could take it to $300T over the subsequent 10 years."

Prenup, prenup, PRENUP!! \n\nNow for a story. \nThere once was this guy named Bob. He met a girl and fell in love, got married, and had two kids. Life was great. So Bob thought. IMO Bob was doing what every partner should do. Supporting his partner while she got her education and helping her become the best version of herself that she wanted to be. The whole time assuming his wife would/was doing the same for him. To make this short, Bob's wife got her education and within months of graduating got caught cheating because she thought she had become better than and had outgrown Bob. Bob lost more than half of everything. His castle, his queen, his kids, and a boatload of money. Bob never imagined this would ever happen. The last meeting with my lawyer. I mean Bob's last meeting with Bob's lawyer to pay his final bill. Bob's lawyer asked what Bob had learned going forward and Bob said prenup.... and the lawyer said Smart man. DON'T BE BOB!!!  Don't worry it ends with a happy ending. Bob found a new girl, discussed a prenup when they first met, and they were in love. She agreed she would sign it. It was fair and also protected her equally. Bob got his house back, has his kids living with him full-time, and travels regularly. Life is good again but this time Bob's protected and so is Bob's new partner. Prenups should be automatic, it doesn't mean you don't love each other. It just protects everyone involved and saves a ton of money in the end. Make it while you're in love and then if it ever does go sideways you know what it will all look like. Almost no need for a lawyer. If your partner refuses to sign. Huge red flag and move on to the next one."

A method to generate mnemonic phrase based on collected entropy and a wordlist. A mnemonic seed phrase generated by this method embeds a checksum that allows to verify that the mnemonic has been entered. \n\n 2. A completely separate method to generate a BIP32 HD wallet seed from the mnemonic seed phrase plus the seed passphrase.\n\n\nThe gereration of the BIP32 seed (thevactual seed) does not require or enforce any specific method of generaring the.mnemonic, but does recommend using the method given in the same document..This open-ended design is intentional to.allow for translated wordlists, custom word lists or even completely different methods of generating the mnemonic,.without.requiring.that the wallet must implement them all. You.could use a Klingon word list to generate the.mnemonic seed and a fully BIP39 compliant waller would let you enter, possibly with a warning that it does not recognize the mnemonic and can not verify it's checksum.\n\n\n\nRegarding the 24th word...the last word is both.entropy and checksum.\n\nENT amount of entropy used when generating the mnemonic\n\nCS checksum size \n\nMS number of words in the resulting mnemonic\n\n\nCS = ENT / 32\n\nMS = (ENT + CS) / 11\n\n|  ENT  | CS | ENT+CS |  MS  |\n+-------+----+--------+------+\n|  128  |  4 |   132  |  12  |\n|  160  |  5 |   165  |  15  |\n|  192  |  6 |   198  |  18  |\n|  224  |  7 |   231  |  21  |\n|  256  |  8 |   264  |  24  |"

I was about to receive some money via Bitcoin and just asked since my knowledge is a few years old from the \"bitcoin core software wallet\" time and chatGpt told that one should never store them online or in a software wallet, which made sense so I just ordered a trezor and it was pretty straightforward. Short version: buy a trezor (or similar hardware wallet), download trezor suite (or similar software for said hardware wallet), set it up when it arrives, pretty easy, make sure to remember and write down (not digitally!!!) your 20 words seed phrase and you're done. if your device stops working, you can buy a new trezor, enter the 20 seed phrases and it will be as a copy of your original wallet, basically. \n\nAnd never! lose! your! seed! phrase!!! \n\nBut honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of AI tools but letting yourself walk through  something like this works pretty well.

But the stock market is over-priced. Are you really calling for hard examples? Because I can show the evidence. There's also a factor people are not considering which is a more longterm issue: Boomers are retiring. And with retirement comes a pull on investments for living expenses. The expected PE ratios of the market should fall where There's less demand for those investments. And they're already bloated as is. The worst part? Boomers aren't going to be working anymore, which drives up the cost of everything. Again, longterm issue. But relevant to the point that dumping everything you have into something blindly might just be feeding the disaster machine. Longterm investments are still a core strategy.

I take the public and private key and turn them into a QR code or alpha-numeric sequence and print it small enough to fit on the silver bar. They are printed on stone spun paper which is rip proof, fire proof, and water proof. Then I cut out the little private key, place it on the silver bar, and apply that holographic security hologram sticker over it to hold it in place. If you peel that hologram sticker up it destroys itself, allowing you access to the private key underneath. It also lets anybody else trying to buy the bar in the future know if the bar has already been redeemed or not. If the hologram sticker is whole and untampered with your bitcoin is secure\u2026.

A fork is just a deviation from these rules defined by the code, so there's no fuzziness in it either.  \n\nWhat might get fuzzy is the estimation what side of the fork has the majority of users, or which one deserves to be called \"bitcoin\" - do you mean this perhaps? But a fork is a fork, it doesn't matter if it's a majority fork or not.  \n\nPerhaps the misunderstanding is that there are two types of consensus: the one referring to the rules of bitcoin that need to be \"in consensus\" (about which transactions are valid, what rules blocks need to comply with etc), and the other one referring to more social consensus (about which rules set is the actual \"bitcoin\")."

      "I don't appreciate when people equate slavery with debt taken on more or less based on individual's choices. If you have a choice to take the loan, and to have the education you have, and to take on the low paying job you have, and to stay in the area you stay, you're not a slave. Learn, move, and get paid better, so you don't need the loan, or get decent loan terms for the mortgage/car and can pay them off sooner. Slavery was, and still is, a horrific practice. If you're not bought and sold, not chained to the wall, not getting randomly beaten and raped, you're not a slave. You're a product of your choices and your environment. Unless you can't change literally anything about those things, stop whining.\n\nAlso, the argument about finite money supply being the fix to everything - are there any examples in history of long term successful implementation of such a system? Where everybody from the top to the bottom were happy enough with their lot?"

      "When gold coins were official legal tender (like the Double Eagle in the U.S.), spending them wasn't a taxable event, just like spending a dollar bill today isn't. However, the U.S. left the gold standard in 1971. Today, if you buy physical gold as an investment and later sell it for a profit, you absolutely pay capital gains tax on it. It's treated as a collectible. \n\nTax authorities like the IRS in the U.S. classify Bitcoin as **property**, not currency. This is the crucial distinction. Because it's property, any time you \"dispose\" of it\u2014whether you sell it for cash, trade it for another crypto, or use it to buy something (like a coffee)\u2014it's a taxable event. You owe capital gains tax on the difference between the price you acquired it at and the price you spent it at. You're right that this makes it very difficult to use for everyday transactions and is a major hurdle to its adoption as a simple currency."

Every year the amount of BTC costs me less. I value each of them the same even if the jersey I bought 3 years ago costs 4x in Bitcoin compared to this years.

How should we know your financial circumstances, income/spending, your risk appetite, your level of knowledge about bitcoin, etc?  \n\nIn the earlier days bitcoin undoubtedly had higher returns but also higher risks (less developed software, no hardware wallets, much more regulatory uncertainty and so on). So today you have less potential returns but also less risk. Does it make it less \"worth investing\"? Again, only you can answer that for you.  \n\nBesides that, the property assurances that bitcoin has (censorship resistance, permissionlessness, hard cap etc) are still the same (even more proven through time), but if you find them worthwhile is once again a very subjective question."

I think some exchanges don't charge a fee to go from USDC to any other crypto, but do charge a fee to go from fiat to crypto. Converting from BTC to anything other than stable coins or fiat is more risky bcuz u r betting on that crypto not losing value against BTC, but 99% of the time, if BTC goes down then everything else goes down as well which means u won't get as much BTC once u r ready to buy back in. But with fiat or stable coins, u'll get more bang for ur buck the lower BTC goes."

By keeping or even strengthening policy filters that discourage oversized, non-payment data (like Ordinals inscriptions), Knots actively protects scarce block space and helps keep transaction fees reasonable for everyday users. Its maintainer, Luke Dashjr, argues that allowing arbitrary data bloat undermines Bitcoin\u2019s primary function as sound money and a peer-to-peer cash system. Critics call this \u201ccensorship,\u201d but Knots doesn\u2019t reject valid consensus transactions\u2014it simply sets stricter relay and mining policies that operators can choose to run. In a world where block space is finite and spam can price out normal payments, Knots provides a pragmatic safeguard for those who value efficiency, predictable fees, and the original monetary use case of Bitcoin."

      "It makes sense to do a risk analysis. How much money might you need in an average emergency multiplied by the average risk of emergency.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you might need $50,000 with an expected chance of 1% per year, and Bitcoin is significantly down 50% of the time, that's 1/2 a percent chance that you'll have to use what should be $100k soon to get $50k now. So that's an expected loss of `50000*.005 = $250` per year, vs keeping that $50k in cash with Bitcoin expected appreciation rate of 20%/year, is `50000*0.2 = $10,000` per year.\n\n\nSo, the question is, would you rather lose $250/year or $10,000/year to cover your risk of needing emergency funds. This is why risk analysis is important.\u00a0\n\n\nIt of course banks on the condition that you have enough Bitcoin to cover an emergency even in a near worst case crash."

If that's the case we will end up at 300K in weeks once the pump actually starts. The only thing that holds it back is cycle theory and whales that may have profited once from it are reactive to it. Smart ones though could leverage or options trade it instead of selling Bitcoin. Especially now with many dex available and services who gives loans based on BTC.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, there's cheaper options more widely available to protect against a cycle crash.\n\nIt's very different than all previous cycles."

It\u2019s not the purest way of doing it, but you\u2019ll see the same gains bitcoin will (minus a tiny fee).\n\nRead one of these two books so you know why bitcoin is a smart investment: \n\n-The Bitcoin Standard (Ammous) or \n\n-Broken Money (Alden).\n\nBoth are stone cold classics.

This can be anything from a little dedicated USB stick miner (e.g. bitaxe) all the way up to the most cutting edge antminers. Miners are rated in hashes per second, so you\u2019ll see ratings like GH/s (gigahash - a billion hashes/sec), TH/s (terrahash - 1000x more), PH/s (petahash - another 1000x), etc.\n\nOnce you have your machine(s), you need to decide how you\u2019re going to operate them. The two basic choices are solo or pooled. Solo means you\u2019re betting the computer power you against the compute power of the entire Bitcoin mining network in a race to see who solves the next block first. If you win, you get the whole block reward(currently 3.5 bit) plus transaction fees. If you run pooled, then your compute power is collectively pooled with many others (increasing the odds of a block reward) and you\u2019re rewarded whatever percentage your compute is of the total each time the pool is rewarded a block.\n\nIn either scenario, more compute is better. The real issue is that these days, unless you\u2019ve got really cheap energy, it\u2019s practically impossible to make a profit mining. Some of us run miners as hobbyists, but the general consensus is use your money to buy bit."

      "I never used Bitcoin well personally, only what I have mentioned previously.\n\nThe 1 hour consultation is good. The more you understand your device the better. It takes ages to understand even if you are good with computers..\n\nWhen the Trezor arrives ensure the seals are intact, also try setting it up twice i.e. the first time you write down your seed words (which you never tell anyone or store digitally) you do this on scrap paper, not the little paper booklet they give you. Why?\n\nBecause the second time you set it up for good, but this time all the words should be different (however words 3 and 4 will be the word 'academic' this is expected and is Trezor meta-data - Don't freak out). By doing this twice not only have you confirmed that the device is generating random words so not tampered with, but you also have more familiarity with the device.\n\nConfused yet? Great... It's difficult.\n\nTry watching some Trezor Safe 5 YouTube videos in advance.\n\nBuy a physical safe, lock the device and the booklet in it. Maybe two safes, one for each. Your choice. This way you have peace of mind knowing that nobody has looked at the words.\n\nNow the brain curling technical bits:-\n\nYour Trezor generates a private key, this is used to sign sending transactions. You can receive Bitcoin without presenting your private key. Anyone can send you Bitcoin, however when you send Bitcoin you need to sign the transaction by presenting the private key.\n\nYou can have many wallets assigned to one private key. If you create a pass phrase (recommend by not until you know exactly what your doing) then a new private key is generated. \n\nNow you have 20/24 seed words plus a pass phrase (and different wallet addresses) Extra secure why? Because those 20/24 seed words are generated from a pre-defined list. The 25 word (passphrase) you can choose.\n\n25th word examples-\n\npassword123!\nPassword123!\n\nThese are different - why because they are case sensitive. Note the capital P for Password.\n\nDon't get caught out, nobody can help you if you get it wrong.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable/confident in creating a 25th passphrase on setting up your device during the first go, then don't. You can do it later. I didn't initially, once I understood more (took a few months) then I did. Hell yeah I did. But only when I understood completely what I was doing and yes I was scared shit less. \n\nDid I mention - Do not lose those words!\n\nNEVER Enter your 20/24 words (plus pass phrase if you choose) into anything other than your Trezor device.\n\nIf you're ever unsure what is going on, stop take a deep breath and think. Your Bitcoin won't go anywhere without your approval.\n\nIf you're sending Bitcoin to yourself, a different wallet, consolidating your UTXOs (unspent transaction operations) then send a small amount first like $20.\n\nUTXO - The most complicated part. If you buy Bitcoin from an Exchange and send it to yourself 5 separate times you will have 5 UTXO's which form the whole amount of Bitcoin you own- You then send those 5 to your self (Yes - Your own wallet address) to consolidate them into 1 UTXO . Think of taking your change to the bank to exchange for a note. Why? Because that saves space on the block chain. Each transaction cost is based in part on the size of data you are sending and how busy the Bitcoin block chain network is. In the future who knows what the cost will be, so it's good to consolidate every once in a while. \n\nMore confused, excellent. Like I said It's difficult.\n\nOnce you have mastered buying Spot ETF and sending to your device you're home and dry.\n\nIn the meantime google 'Mempool' - This is the Bitcoin block chain operating 24/7 - Poke around and watch the transactions happen in real time. It's fun.\n\nWhat you have chosen is not easy, but you made the right choice.\n\nIf you have any more questions, come back here and ask. I will try to answer publicly and to the best of my ability.\n\nIt's good to have you here. Best of luck."

Sometimes prices stay below their all time highs for years.\n\nDiversify enough that you can sleep at night. That'll be somewhere between 0-100%>\n\nNot investment advice. Just my opinion."

But having the strategy of  \"buying when it drops and selling when it goes up\" is timing the market. If it goes up to 120k, it's not a horrible thing to take some profit. And it drops by 60k, you can buy some more. \n\nBut it's dangerous. For example, what if it goes up to 120k  and you sell, then it keeps going up until 160k before it drops to 130k? Do you then buy back because of the drop? That would be a loss. Or do you never buy again because you wanna wait until it's down to where you wanted to buy back? \n\nWhat happens often is that you maybe wait a a bit hoping for a bigger dip, but it goes up, so you end up buying back at 150k, but then it dips and you freak out.\n\nMeanwhile the one who just bought some more every month is gonna make a better profit.\n\nI mean, you can absolutely sell some when it goes up and try to buy back when it goes down, but it's absolutely trying to time the market and it's often a losing strategy. Even though it's less of a gamble"

This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.\n> \n> If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.\n> \n> SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including \"You received 10000000 BTC!\"). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.\n> \n> Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.\n> \n> So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.\n> \n> Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.\n> \n> Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lnd/"

I haven't heard him talk about it in around four or five years so maybe his opinion has evolved but, there are real risks. \n\nI think some of us have to take chances on fiancial stability, sure we can end up worse than before but at least at the end you can say you went for it.

Each \u201cera\u201d produces half as many new coins as the one before, totalling 10.5 million BTC in the first era, 5.25 million in the next, and so on.

Here's an example from 2022: \n\n[](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FMisterSpread%2Fstatus%2F1799834753283293235&psig=AOvVaw1VFEJE7bVM_5CLOLhS9Nhj&ust=1760688350126000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBYQjhxqFwoTCNCm6LOhqJADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)Seems like a perfect play from MM to liquidate all of the leveraged longs by dunking it, grabbing that liquidity and eliminating overhead sell pressure, then using the shorts at the bottom to liquidate them and \n\nWell, that or the top was 6th October, as per the 1064 day trend from bear market bottom to top.   \n  \nRight now, I am holding, but as I am a trader not a hodler, I will yeet my bags (probably by end of this year), since I am up big since the lows in late 2022, and buy back in oct 2026.\n\nQ4 2026 should be big buying opp once again for stocks, gold and bitcoin, all due to bottom within a month of each other.\n\nUp huge on all of them so far, but just sitting back and letting the market do its thing."

You probably get enough through dividends and other returns to fund your lifestyle.\n\nAn asset-backed loan here is the way to fund further expansion of your investment and to increase yield on your existing assets.

And you have to value it against something of the daily living, like 1 btc = 100000 USD, or 1 btc 0.2 avg houses, or 3 avg cars.

So while as a currency it is technically portable, magically so, it can never, on its own, be portable at global scale.\n\nThis where the Lightning layer (there are others) shines.\n\n2. All the other bits of your thesis are muddled.  Any new currency goes through an adoption phase.  The USD didn\u2019t start as a global reserve currency it used to be Pound Sterling.  And before that precious metals primarily gold/silver.\n\nWhere BTC fails is as a Stable store of value.  It\u2019s certainly no secret that relative to other currencies it has rapidly appreciated.  And setting aside the impact of the rapid inflation (devaluation) of the USD, it has still gone crazy.\n\nThis counterparty risk is unacceptable for a currency.  This is the same reason inflation is built into the Brenton woods model.  If the currency is truly, magically stable, there is significantly less motivation to invest,  you just save.\n\nBTC doesn\u2019t have inflation, so it\u2019s a commodity."

Here\u2019s Something Different #\n\nMost of us have heard the stories about Bitcoin back when it was under a dollar \u2014 a time when almost nobody believed it would matter. That era is long gone, and no one expects it to come back. But there\u2019s a new project that\u2019s taking a similar path from the very beginning: **BC2 (Bitcoin II).**\n\nIt\u2019s built from the same base code as Bitcoin, using **SHA-256 Proof-of-Work**, the same **21 million limit**, and the same **halving schedule.** No meme branding, no shortcuts \u2014 just a clean restart of the original idea. Right now it\u2019s trading around $0.95, roughly the price of a coffee.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that BC2 isn\u2019t trying to replace Bitcoin or reach its price. It\u2019s not about competing \u2014 it\u2019s about revisiting what made the first network special in the first place: fairness, simplicity, and transparency. The community is small but active, with miners, developers and early holders helping shape the network from the ground up.\n\nEverything\u2019s transparent; you can check the explorer and live dashboard at bitcoin-ii.org. It\u2019s already listed on **CoinEx**, so it\u2019s more than just a whitepaper idea.\n\nNo one here is pretending this will become the next Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s not the goal. The point is to rebuild the same foundations, start fresh, and see what can grow when things are still open enough for individuals to make a real impact.\n\nbitcoin-ii.org"

I doubt it. look, Blackrock is completely on-board with the IBIT ETF. it currently hodls 802,000 BTC worth around $85b\n\ncompanies like Blackrock are not in it to lose money, and I am sure they have seriously and deeply considered all scenarios, like quantum computers, major hacks, major bugs, change in legislation, a hard fork, and so on. in every scenario they are not going to lose money, simple as that\n\nand also it is a $2T asset, there's never been a case in history, ever, when an asset would get to $2T and then disappear. simply does not happen. because it would cause tremendous economic pain to a number of powerful companies, banks and countries.\n\never since Blackrock got redpilled, there is simply no safer investment than BTC. we have arrived\n\nI would totally use it as a long term savings account, just make sure there's no need to sell at the most inconvenient moment"

If the answer is \"yes\", then buy affordable amounts at regular intervals - i.e. DCA. Also, if you can, diversify your savings across non-fiat/non-cash investments - not just Bitcoin. Though, Bitcoin is one of the best long-term plays at the moment.\n\nDetermining the answer to that question is also quite simple, it is currently \"Yes\" and it's going to be \"Yes\" for quite a while. And I think it will remain \"Yes\" until Bitcoin and 1 or 2 other crypto-currencies have utterly cannibalised the entire market for mid to long term cash-denominated investment vehicles.

Here\u2019s why: \n\nWhat Stands Out \n\nRepetitive mentions of the same token ($WHITENET / $WHITE) across multiple, unrelated subreddits (r/AllCryptoBets, r/memecoins, r/solana, r/btc, r/CryptoPeople, etc.). This is a hallmark of a coordinated promotion effort. \n\nDirect investment enticements: \n\n\u201cBuy now before it goes public\u201d \n\n\u201cBest entries happen before the masses show up\u201d \n\n\u201cPotential upside is insane\u201d \n\n\u201cCheck it out at whiterock.fi\u201d (with repeated links to the same site) \n\nThose are calls to action encouraging purchase/investment. \n\nHype & FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) tactics: \n\n\u201cGenerational plays are made\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can already sense the momentum building\u201d \n\n\u201cInstitutional backing\u201d and \u201clong-term believers\u201d language \n\nThis is persuasive advertising language, not neutral discussion. \n\nLink dropping: Direct links to the project site (\u201cwhiterock.fi\u201d, \u201cnetwork.whiterock.fi/contribute?code=SHE\u201d) appear over and over. This moves it firmly into advertising/solicitation territory. \n\nHow Different Groups Should View This \n\nReddit Mods \n\nAlmost all of these posts violate subreddit rules on self-promotion, spam, and shilling. \n\nThey should see this as coordinated marketing, not genuine contribution. Likely to be mass-removed and the account banned. \n\nRegulators (SEC, FCA, ASIC, etc.) \n\nBecause these posts encourage investment and contain links to a contribution page, they could count as financial promotions. \n\nIf the poster is affiliated with the project (developer, team member, or paid promoter), regulators would expect full disclosure. \n\n\u201cNot financial advice\u201d disclaimers won\u2019t protect against liability if the intent is promotional. \n\nThe repeated emphasis on future profit (\u201cupside,\u201d \u201cearly believers,\u201d \u201cbuy before public launch\u201d) may be interpreted as investment solicitation \u2014 which in many jurisdictions requires licensing or approval. \n\nBottom Line \n\nThis is not innocent commenting.\nIt\u2019s a clear case of enticing buyers through promotional posting across multiple Reddit pages. \n\nIt looks like a shilling campaign designed to build hype and attract investment."

There is no economic theory under which a useless crippled SoV token would maintain its value. This is why they\u2018re so befuddled by its price rise. I\u2018m not befuddled by that. That\u2018s the expected outcome of a SoV ponzi scheme.\n\nSecondly, none of these economists has read the whitepaper, nor do they have any understanding of the scope of uselessness of BTC. They\u2018re not looking at the right things. However, system functioning always trumps any economic theory of this or that. Because it\u2018s code.

And we know banks and investment funds are specially prepared to sell you the most smelly block of poo has being the next great thing.\n\nIt has significant limitations in terms of programmability, coordenation, energy and value distribution without any dump safe guards. Gate keepers are needed, its a question of safety, and BTC is the complete anarchy of responsibility. If it implodes there are no people you could sit at a tribunal.\n\nI think there is a massive bunch of tech nerds that only understand ones and zeros on a screen but have no clue how politically complex the world is. Most of those guys can't see further than the next pump or can't grasp how monolithic the world would be without banks. Maxys don't understand that people will never be ready to fully compreende the impact of their financial decisions. Most people smoke and/or drink and/or take drugs and/or eat poorely and/or don't exercise and/or don't educate theirs kids well.... forget about finance maturity XD\n\nBanks, as an institution, aren't the problem, the real problem is the corruption and misalignment with core ethical principals you find inside banks and the products/services they are allowed to sell and the financial/political movements they are allowed to take. I'm all for the banks, the problem is the greedy almost psychopathic people you find inside the banks administration. \n\nPersonal note: I have the luck of being educated by an excellent account manager, even when I got divorced of a 7 years marriage, the guy was truly a super professional and a great human. He did everything he could not only prevent further suffering but also to ensure we (me and my ex) did things the right way and fairly. He is still our (me and my ex) manager and from time to time he calls me just to ask if i'm happy with his service and if I need any assistance or have any questions. I have zero complaints, my bank has no monthly fees or transfer fees and has lots of services suitable for different costumer profiles.\n\nThat being said, I think DLT is a great tech that will improve every costumers day. It will challenge this industry to be more ethical and give the best value to costumers or else the account based system will become a wallet based system and we will go from a Bank to a Ledger, or a Trezor, or a lite Wallet, or a decentralized smart contract platform or even a centralized one that gives a better service."

But at the same time with some effort and study, the non average Joe can store their digital gold as well without depending on third parties.\n\n\nFor me is far easier to store and transport the bitcoin digital gold than physical gold. That's the main advantage, besides being a deflationary asset."

Like structural demand (institutional inflows, long\u2011term accumulation) sets a trend, while liquidity and market microstructure determine how flows move the price. Macro variables, especially real yields and monetary conditions like M2 (the money supply or the \"money printer\" if you like) shape the backdrop.  \n  \n\"Looser\" liquidity and falling real rates have a positive effect on BTC, while tighter conditions seem to hurt it. Leverage and funding in derivatives seem to trigger fast, forced squeezes, and on\u2011chain signals (exchange reserves, miner selling) show real supply pressure.  \n  \nRetail hype and sudden changes in rules and regulations (read: investor's uncertainty) cause mood and price swings. I think no single factor dominates, but they all matter. The challenge is then to find a strategy that makes the right combination of institutional flow, macro yields, derivatives risk, and on\u2011chain metrics."

Guy asks \"Which?\" then answers himself \"X\", but it wasn't really ever a question it was an ad\n\nThat being said, a serious answert for the possibly masked question:\n\nI can recommend swapspace dot co, because it's an aggregator, it creates competitive pressure between various partners: loweing KYC requirements and fees competition. I am pleased with using it. More information, less dependency on specific business. It could be used just as information source for more paranoid people, then they may go to best selected sites directly\n\nAlways DYOR, trust no one. Don't make big txs, you likely not in a hurry, relax"

      "No. This video just scapegoats the Fed. The reason that the cost of living has gone up is because of the debt and how we manage financial crises. In short, the government has borrowed a lot of money for various reasons. That money goes into the financial system meaning, there are more dollars in the system. That means that there are more dollars available to purchase goods, services, and financial assets. Because there are more dollars available, prices rise.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat the Fed does is help manage financial crises. To be honest, they could do a much better job of managing crises, but still, before the Fed existed, economic booms and busts were a lot more dramatic, and caused a lot more harm than they have since the Fed was created. If you think things are bad now, without the Fed, you would literally have nothing after the COVID.\u00a0\n\n\nThe people who demonize the Fed have a financial interest, that doesn't involve you, for abolishing it.\u00a0"

      "For a regular Solana user, the introduction of p-token could mean several practical benefits, depending on how it plays out. Here's a breakdown in simple terms:\n\n1. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: P-token is designed to cut compute usage by about 95% for the token program, which handles most transactions on Solana (like sending SOL or other tokens). This could lead to lower transaction fees and quicker processing times, making it cheaper and smoother to use apps, trade tokens, or move money on the network.\n2. Improved Experience: With less strain on the network, you might notice fewer delays or glitches, especially during busy times. Solana has had outages in the past, and this upgrade could help make it more reliable for everyday use, like buying NFTs or staking SOL.\n3. Potential Delays Before Benefits: Right now, the process is stuck on audits and validator approval (SIMD-266). This could take weeks or months, so you won\u2019t see these improvements immediately. \n4. No Direct Action Needed: As a user, you likely won\u2019t need to do anything special\u2014wallets and apps should update automatically once p-token is live. Just keep an eye on announcements from Solana or your wallet provider."

      "I guess you know rugcheck.xyz. This site gives a good overview of potential risks. \n\nThe biggest pain point probably is being able to keep tracking everything without spending loads of money when starting with a small budget.\n\nYou can start tracking new tokens for free when using multiple providers that offer free rpc nodes and just push everything into questdb, for example. You can also do a lot of checks that are done by rugcheck yourself with the data of those free nodes. You'll quickly get a blacklist for creators of rugged tokens and so on. That's not the problem. But keeping up with the prices for new tokens definitely is when using free APIs as the list of active tokens grows.\n\nLong story short, if you're not able to pay hundreds per month, you can still easily collect a lot of interesting data, but it's hard to keep track of the token prices after some time. This specifically makes backtesting not totally impossible but definitely hard and somehow limited. As the data collection grows, you're potentially able to extend the rules to mark tokens as rugged or not interesting early, but at least for me, it's a slow process."

No-operation transactions are transactions that use minimal resources and the intention was to squeeze as many of these transactions into a block as possible. \n\nThat 107k TPS also includes approximately 70% vote transactions so it was actually 32k TPS.\n\nIncreasing the TPS also required a 4% block size increase in April and another 20% increase in July. An additional 66% increase is planned for late Q3 or Q4. This is a tradeoff in decentralization because it increases hardware requirements and ledger growth. The 66% increase will almost double hardware requirements and increase ledger growth by about 150% while the ledger is already over 400TB and growing 80-100TB/year.\n\nThis stress-test doesn't reflect real world usage or true capability and isn't a breakthrough in scaling. Current real TPS (excl. vote txs) is 500-1000."

Rather than having to mint a token and then provide liquidity for it (which is quite a lot of money if you want a fairly stable coin off launch), you can just launch one real quick where there is no need for extra funding for an LP. The only thing the user pays is ~0.025SOL for the token creation and then of course however much for the initial buy.

But if I held an extra day I would have gotten like 2500 more. But I'm not gonna hold 6500 on the hope that it turns into more. Bc almost no airdrop ever does that. You should always flip an airdrop into usdc"

Relying on\u00a0getTransaction\u00a0after a\u00a0logsSubscribe\u00a0event is definitely going to burn through your RPC credits and will still have a slight lag.\n\nThe big third-party APIs (like Birdeye, etc.) are your best bet for a simple solution, but as you said, they can be expensive and often don't meet that sub-1.5s latency requirement for a large number of pairs.\n\nHonestly, what you're trying to build is a core component of what high-performance trading bots do under the hood. They need to have the absolute latest price data to execute trades effectively and protect against MEV.\n\nMy team and I actually use a Telegram-based bot, JitoX, for our execution. While it's a trading tool on the front-end, its entire backend is an engine built to solve this exact data problem. It maintains a high-speed connection to the Jito block engine, which gives it access to transaction data and state changes faster than a standard RPC connection. This allows it to calculate real-time prices and execute trades with minimal latency.\n\nInstead of spending a ton of time and money building out this complex data infrastructure yourself, you might find it more efficient to leverage a tool that has already perfected it.\n\nThe bot is\u00a0JitoXai\\_bot\u00a0if you want to check out how it performs. It's a good example of a system that has solved the low-latency price feed problem."

      "Hey, happy to.\n\nIt's less of an 'app' in the traditional sense and more of a specialized trading terminal. The core idea is to solve the biggest frustrations that cost traders money on Solana.\n\nInstead of juggling a web browser, a wallet pop-up for every approval, and a DEX interface, it consolidates everything into a single, clean command-based environment. This means you can execute trades much faster, which is critical for new launches or volatile markets.\n\nBut the real magic is under the hood. It's built directly on the Jito block engine, which is essentially a high-speed, MEV-protected lane for transactions. Think of it like a shield. It helps stop your trades from getting \"sniped\" by sandwich bots, which is the main reason a trader's PnL shows a profit but their wallet is mysteriously down. It ensures the price you get is way closer to the price you clicked.\n\nIt's really built for traders who are tired of the 'invisible' costs of slippage, failed transactions during high-volume launches, and the general clumsiness of trying to trade quickly on a mobile browser.\n\nI'd drop the details here, but the r/solana mods (rightfully) don't allow links or handles to external groups in the comments to prevent spam.\n\n**Feel free to shoot me a DM, and I'll send you the info.**"

If I'm close to the mark by saying SOL will go down another ten or $15, Galaxy and Forward Industries could buy 15% more SOL for the same money they paid a few days ago. \n\nIf that happens, I can see Solana aiming for mid $270s by the end of October. \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, right before BTC & ETH had ETF approvals, their prices went down as well. This might be a similar case"

      "Same thing just happened to me, though I lost it because I was naive. So I put about 400 dollars into crypto to give it a fair shot after all these years of just trading stocks. I did plenty of research on technical analysis, up and coming coins, which tools to use, how to not to get rug pulled etc. This morning I stumbled upon a YouTube video of a guy claiming to explain it all again and how he was a 19yr old millionaire, which I took with a grain of salt but I figured more knowledge can\u2019t hurt right? So I see in the video he recommends using a laptop so you can move between tabs and execute orders quicker which made sense. He recommended downloading phantom as an extension on your laptop so it makes it even easier (of which I had already had my funds on, which was being stashed in $USCR) which also made sense. Now with all this fancy \u2018knowledge\u2019 I acquired, and videos I watched you would think I would be smart enough to make sure it\u2019s the official phantom extension or not trust it at all\u2026 nope. All it asked for to connect my wallet was the recovery phrase (of course I also had no understanding of)so I blindly entered it and it downloaded. I first noticed when I only had 5 dollars of sol in my account, so I tried checking the manage tab. Nothing. Tried logging out and back in. Nothing. Then I checked transactions, which showed I sent all the $USCR to some random account. Looked it up on solscan and yea, they got me. I know it wasn\u2019t much but it was as much as I was comfortably able to risk and now I have to wait to earn enough so I don\u2019t put myself into a bad position financially. Sucks I\u2019m gonna miss the crypto run this year. I know it\u2019s completely my fault and I should\u2019ve never trusted a website nor should I have given out my recovery phrase, I\u2019ve deleted my wallet and created a new one but it has the same username, just a different phrase which I hope means it\u2019s not compromised still. I\u2019m sure most people are smart/ informed enough to not do this but if it can help anyone\u2026 don\u2019t give that phrase out smh."

But only if demand still meets the capacity.\n\nIf you have 1000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 100 tx, you get a fee market for these 100 tx and the highest paying 100 tx from the pool of 1000 make the cut. \n\nIf you have 8000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 10000 tx, **everyone** pays **nothing**. 8000 x 0 = 0. And that's bad design in my opinion, because it means the possible 5000 of the 8000 tx which are uneconomical pointless spam are included too. It also leads to any capacity always eventually filling up with spam. \n\n>I think it's more likely that we'll see novel uses once there is much higher capacity.\n\nYeah, I dunno, that's the \"overestimate growth based on faith and hopium\" part I mentioned. Sure you can hope for new use cases, but that's betting on black swans. The network shouldn't work like that, it should not keep lowering fees while scaling blindly, assuming future usecases popping up to save the day."

I hope you didnt lose everything, and looking on the bright side, at least it wasn't a wallet drainer.\n\nA compliment to you: you're already using a decentralized storage (MM wallet), good on you for that. But, then I must ask: why not stay decentralized and swap on Uniswap rather than a centralized exchange? This would not require you to send to any address, unless you really want to cash out to USD rather than just hold USDC or DAI.\n\nI wish you the best!"

      "> truth\n\nIf you *actually* believe the things you said, maybe it's worth correcting you?\n\n> And Vitalik can fork the code at will\n\nThe truth is that *anyone* can fork the code at will. Anyone can make a copy of the client code, make a few changes, and compile and run the new code. That's easy. Trivial even.\n\nThe hard part is convincing everyone else on the network to run the new code. Unless everyone else runs the same code as you, then any transactions you make will not be seen by everyone else, and your transactions will be inconsequential and ignored. Basically, running forked code by yourself means that you have created a new network that nobody cares about and has no value.\n\nThe thing Vitalik is really good at is *convincing other people* to run new code. He does this with a combination of being *smart*, *trustworthy*, and *eloquent*. He has good ideas with pretty high consistency, and he also listens well to other developers and adopts their ideas (with attribution, of course), and he does an unusually good job of explaining those ideas in blog posts and whatnot in a fashion that Ethereum aficionados are able to understand and appreciate. And he is trustworty in that he has never proposed rule changes that would be self-serving, or motivated by anything other than the desire for Ethereum to succeed. If he did, then he would lose respect and people would stop running his code.\n\nThis happened once, actually. With the DAO fork, not everyone was convinced that undoing the hack was a good idea. Only about 85% supported reverting the hack, and 15% chose to stick to Ethereum Classic instead. The Ethereum developers (including Vitalik) can't force anyone to run new, forked code. They can only propose it. The users are the ones who ultimately choose what code Ethereum runs on."

Leo believes that most of the bull cases for ETH miss the point: the real reasons to stay convicted on ETH are both simpler and more powerful.\n\nJT and Leo will be talking about:\n\n* ETH narratives and what makes ETH worth holding when narratives shift\n* Whether ETH should be thought of as money, tech stock, or something else entirely\n* How real users and real utility show up in the bull case. \n\nWatch live on Friday, August 22 at 2pm EST on the EVMavericks Discord, YouTube and X!\n\n[https://discord.gg/evmavericks](https://discord.gg/evmavericks)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks/streams](https://www.youtube.com/@evmavericks/streams)  \n[https://x.com/EVMavericks](https://x.com/EVMavericks)\n\nOr watch on demand on a long list of popular channels; you can get the full list (and upcoming guests) on Hanniabu's website: [https://dailydoots.com/podcast/](https://dailydoots.com/podcast/)"

      "Thank you for the question Pintail, and great to see issuance as a top voted question :)\n\n> It is still true that under the current curve all rational ETH holders will eventually (be forced to) stake their ETH\n\nShort answer: IMO yes\n\nLong answer: The issuance curve is designed such that nominal yield from issuance alone is at least 2%/year, even when all 121M ETH is staked. Operational costs (compute & bandwidth, devops, inactivity & slashing risks, activation & exit inefficiencies) are typically small (measured in basis points) and will go down significantly with things like L1 EVM SNARKification and attester-proposer separation (APS). As such the dominant staking cost is arguably external opportunity cost, e.g. from defi.\n\nToday there's roughly [2.5M ETH earning 2%/year on Aave](https://app.aave.com/). Even at today's levels, 2%/year is insufficient to have a significant impact on staking. Going forward it may be reasonable to expect defi yields to compress, e.g. as institutional money won't be afraid to lend in size. A final note is that defi yields are somewhat correlated and indirectly boosted by staking yields which will naturally go down from the current 3%/year.\n\nTo summarise, yes, IMO it's reasonable to expect staking costs to stay under nominal staking yields, and therefore for the total amount of ETH staked to keep growing as ETH holders increasingly grow rational.\n\n> How are researchers currently thinking about the process for reaching consensus on a suitable long term issuance curve?\n\nIMO a good first step would be to educate on the negative externalities of most ETH being staked:\n\n * **erosion of pristine collateral**: Staking absorbs yield-seeking pristine ETH, leaving relatively little for defi. We're seeing a taste of that today: defi markets are dwarfed relative to staking markets (e.g. 2.5M ETH in Aave vs 35.7M ETH staked). Another dynamic is LSTs finding their way into defi. For example in Aave there's 1.2M wstETH (earning 0.05%/year) and 0.3M rsETH (earning <0.01%/year). These LSTs add risks (smart contract risk, operator risk, governance risk), fragment the market, as well as compete with ETH as a unit of account which may negatively affect ETH's monetary premium.\n * **overpayment for security**: The primary goal of issuance is to pay for economic security. Most people would argue 50% of all ETH is insufficient economic security. IMO issuance expended to get the staking rate beyond 50% is wasteful. This waste materialises as fundamental sell pressure through income taxes, as well as memetic sell pressure through unnecessary nominal dilution.\n\n> no longer a sense of urgency about this problem\n\nIssuance is Ethereum's equivalent of global warming. It slowly creeps over, year after year. I remain optimistic that as the negative externalities become increasingly acute, and as the community increasingly appreciates the difference between nominal real staking yields, urgency will increase.\n\nAs I wrote this answer I decided to purchase realyield.org. If anyone would like to build a high-quality educational website on the difference between nominal and real yields, and as well as the negative externalities of overstaking, please do get in touch :)\n\n> How long do we have to take action on this?\n\nThere is arguably a limited window of opportunity to take action because core features of Ethereum like issuance naturally tend towards ossification. I would hope that issuance is addressed within the next 5 years, ideally sooner.\n\nIMO we need an issuance champion. The equivalent of Tim Beiko for EIP-1559, of Danny Ryan for the merge, or Potuz for ePBS. If that's you please step up\u2014my DMs are open. It will be a challenging but meaningful journey, and despite the cries of nominal yield enjoyoors the community at large will root and cheer for you."

      "I see a difference between 7782, which is a proposal for a feature (shorter slots) but is not clearly opinionated on a solution to achieve it, vs 7732 which is a specific solution to ship. Likewise, we should ideally first have a strong view on what the network needs and then coordinate on how to ship it, i.e., decide the specific solution and accelerate its development. If feature proposals cannot hope to compete against solution proposals because they are more under-specified, we need a way to have stronger commitments behind features, so that research and engineering resources can be aligned and the right features can be accelerated, vs deciding based on \"Proof-of-Work\".\n\nAs for Glamsterdam, the network needs scale, and while [I personally don't think that every part of 7732 justifies its cost](https://x.com/barnabemonnot/status/1953773053785051279), 7732 answers the need for scale and so is a good update in my view. Meanwhile, prototyping and metrics collection efforts are ongoing for shorter slots, mostly in EF Protocol teams but also in discussion with core devs. I remain convinced that shorter slots is one of the highest-impact proposals we should accelerate today (see the pitch [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7782-the-case-for-2x-shorter-slot-times-in-glamsterdam/24616)).\n\nSo I think we're working towards a better pipelined decision process that separates the feature selection (ideally driven by community and product considerations) from the solution selection (ideally driven by research and core devs)."

      "I wouldn't call it a blocker necessarily - more of an engineering challenge :')\n\nThis is a multi faceted problem, but one of the large ones is propagating so many small attestation messages through such a large network in such a short period of time. At 1.1m validators, each subnet handles ~500 attestations per slot. Critically, the aggregators on these subnets need to see 66% of the votes in a reasonable amount of time for the chain to stablize. This is a lower bound though as 66% isn't really acceptable. We'd likely see highly sophisticated and well-resourced operators trend towards the \"fast enough\" 66% attesters, while under-resourced operators like home stakers fall outside -- not good.\n\nWe've spent a lot of time recently buffing up our observability at the p2p layer, and have some interesting data here. [I've just run some analysis on the last 24h of `missed slots` on Mainnet.](https://i.imgur.com/UHIrhpV.png) Missed slots are useful since all consensus clients release their attestations at the same time (4s) if they don't see a block. All of the instances here are running on attestation subnets `0` and `1` to filter out noise. Over this period, aggregated, it takes 780ms to propagate 66% of attestations, and 1960ms to hit 95%.\n\nThe challenge is obviously in that long tail - the attesters that are between p66 and p95. [We can actually see which entities are in there too](https://i.imgur.com/1rlHIjJ.png). This isn't weighted by stake or anything, so take it with a grain of salt, but interesting nonetheless. \n\nAttestations (and shorter slot times) haven't really been a focus until recently. Single Attestations occupy 4s of the 12s slot budget (with another 4s for aggregation!), and have been \"working\" since the beacon chain launched because of this generous budget. The good news is I personally think there is a lot of low hanging fruit in this space. For example: when we initially conducted the above analysis as a part of the 6s slot push for Glamsterdam we noticed that Kiln was disproportionately appearing in the long tail of attestations. Toni from the Prototyping team reached out and we saw a large improvement on the back of some changes they made to their infra (ty Kiln!). I fully expect that we'll find more of these. Not just in operator setups, but in clients, and the p2p layer itself."

When you send USDC, you're calling Curcle's contracts to move the money.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not like Tornado cash which was built for anonyminity and just happens to be used for money laundering.\n\n\nAs stablecoins grow, why would countries not go after Circle and require them to have controls in place for onboarding users and deciding who can and can't transmit it?\n\n\nEven if they don't go after them, the money transmitting use case for USDC is likely exchange-to-exchange transfers.\n\n\nIf people using exchanges somehow shield Circle from liability and requirements to register as a money transmitter, then wouldn't Circle's centralized L1 still be a perfect substitute for a decentralized L1? Exchanges are handling the KYC, AML, and related regulations.\u00a0"

      ">\tIf the exchanges can be regulated, then countries can make the receiver provide details on who they recieved the funds from, and if the sender is a citizen of the destination country (which is common for remittance), they can impose restrictions on them.\u00a0\n\nMany crypto exchanges in the US ask people for proof of source of funds occasionally, and in practice it\u2019s completely unworkable.\n\nNot that I would recommend anyone do this, but people can make up any story of how they got their crypto and there\u2019s no way for an exchange to check it, unless the crypto\u2019s source is inherently obvious in the last blockchain hop or they spend money on an expensive forensic analyst to manually connect the dots (which they can\u2019t afford to do for every tom dick and harry).\n\nIMO either a country allows crypto inflows and outflows, or they ban all crypto exchanges for the general public (and even then p2p trading will always exist). Anywhere in between isn\u2019t very workable.\n\n>\tThey can always transfer other tokens, but if they do that, the use case works without stablecoins and the killer app of blockchains is just unregistered money transmission.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m picturing a wallet that automatically sells stablecoins for ETH, transmits them to an exchange, and the exchange automatically sells them for local currency. That does the same thing as selling USDC directly.\n\nThe exchange can\u2019t ban all ETH that has any blockchain history of interacting with the USDC contract, because that\u2019s nearly all ETH in existence.\n\n>\tI\u2019m all for making remittance easy and removing the power of intermediaries, but the sales pitch for this killer app is that a large, centralized company under US jurisdiction can control money transmission for the rest of the world.\n>\n>\t\n>\n>\tThat doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing in general, and I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a unique position for Ethereum other than most of the USDC is on Ethereum.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing either.

Here is the thing to consider about investing in ETH with the current landscape: Now that ETH Treasury companies have come online, if you are new and not planning to capitalize on growing your own assets within the DeFi ecosystem yourself, then treasury companies can do that for you. That means that, if you want to accumulate ETH, treasury companies can grow a 1 ETH purchase by far more than the average user can on their own. This was really not available to ETH investors until this year... These treasuries already have the in-house knowledge on how to make +/- 8% passively on your ETH by putting what you purchase to work through different risk-balanced strategies. If you are interested in this approach of purchasing ETH stock through treasuries, as always, please DYOR before investing."

You probably aren't pulling ETH from the exchange if you're just planning to sell it again once it bounces back to $4500. We only broke 17M reserves 5 days ago, we're already under 16.5M now.\n\nIn other bullish news, BNMR reports they acquired another 260k ETH over the last week. If their mantra is to buy when there is liquidity they should have found some liquidity last night. So hopefully this is all just another half a million ETH that found stronger hands. BNMR mNav is still there to let them leverage up more so that gravy train isn't over.\n\nWhales are clearly accumulating. We haven't even begun to see the effects of all that DAT ETH in Defi and staking yet. Every day the yield they earn on all that ETH is going to remove more and more of the supply from the market. Eventually a combination of rate cuts and purchasing at this rate is going to exhaust sellers. I'll reevaluate my bullish sentiment when I see all the DATs stop buying, the whale wallet accumulation turn into distribution, or a rate hike. Until then, I have more ETH every day from liquidity farming."

      "Ethereum tech is better than it has ever been with the recent Pectra upgrade shipping, and even more improvements are on the horizon with Fusaka. In fact, it feels like the massive research investments are finally paying off, with L1 and L2 being extremely usable under all-time high demand for blockspace. Also, more demand for blockspace is coming, and only one chain makes sense for tokenizing the global financial system. The global financial system is fractured and slow, and putting it on Ethereum will create disruptive value.\n\n\nI'm personally psyched that we're getting sad about the price... and it's still over $4k. If you consider that FED interest rates are dropping for strictly political reasons and a US deficit of roughly $1.7TN for 2026, the shift to risk, out of necessity, is undeniable. Ethereum is misunderstood, panned, and the best long-term risk/reward play in the entire market, at the moment. Treasuries will take years to reclaim the value lost to the debasement of the dollar in the past 9 months alone, US equities are at ATH multiples already (31 years!) in a country that will experience population decline and make-or-break political turbulence before the breakeven period is complete. Bitcoin has existential security issues possible within the same timeframe. Global equities have lower PE multiples, but live and die by a complex web of liquidity and political pressures that only the most savvy investors can navigate. A multi-year commodity bull seems certain, but tariffs can fuck up a thesis in a matter of minutes. \n\n\nDoes anyone know of an undervalued, emerging digital commodity that industry leaders have identified as the core of the future financial system? One with few legitimate competitors and almost insurmountable strategic advantages? Perhaps something decentralized and operationally immune to the comings and goings of individual nations, companies, and currencies. Price can go up and down, but Ethereum is the real deal. There's massive asymmetry in this trade, but you are here. You're \"in the know\". It will seem obvious looking back, but There Is No Alternative."

It is shaping up to be one of the largest onchain rewards programs ever built - in MetaMask Rewards Season 1 alone, we'll be distributing over $30M in LINEA token rewards.  \n  \nWe're intending for this to be a genuine method of regularly giving back to our community.  \n  \nAnd to the OGs... we see you.   \n  \nLong-time MetaMask users will not be ignored - they'll be given special benefits, and MetaMask Rewards will have meaningful connections with the future MetaMask token.  \n  \nWe\u2019ll have more details to share and will be rolling out the full program in the next couple of weeks.  \n  \nStay tuned."

Anti-fragile / resilient?\n\nWhat I mean here is that this accelerating growth of really big entities in the validator set can easily lead to a situation where Ethereum, as an ecosystem, is forced to choose between doing:\n\na) whatever these large entities want (directly or indirectly via pressure from regulators)\nb) what it has done until now and what is more aligned with the values of us, users of Ethereum\n\nFor instance, let's say the large entities get pressured to take a stance against introducing privacy features on Ethereum. That has a very real possibility of happening imo. And let's assume 70% of Ethereum's validators are under the control of the handful of big entities. That could lead to a very tricky and contentious hard fork situation.\n\nOf course, you and I could say, who cares about the anti-privacy fork. But if a large portion of staked ETH chooses that fork when it happens, that ETH can never go back to the pro-privacy fork. Would probably end up being a huge mess.\n\nThat's why I view these really big staking entities as a much larger threat to Ethereum than even Lido at 30% of the staking market share. A handful of entities can do a lot of damage."

There is no decentralized alternative to this; any decentralized chain has some capacity limit, and congestion will happen if the chain has actual use. There is the way that Solana deals with congestion, which is to simply drop/fail the vast majority of tx, it's basically luck if your tx makes it through. That is an insane way of handling congestion, just insane. Nobody serious who understands this would ever build a new financial system on top of *that*. \n\nWhenever you are priced out of making a transaction on Ethereum, someone else is evidently still priced in, willing to pay that price. And that makes their tx a priority instead of yours. It's the only fair way to handle it."

Hence the violent corrections and huge liquidations. \n\nThe Trump dump was on a whole other level, 10x larger than FTX triggered liquidations. So the people/firms that have been driving the price of ETH up got a ginormous haircut and some wont have survived. \n\nWho is the buyer of ETH now? DATs have some regular upward pressure which seems to mostly be matching regular sell pressure. There\u2019s no layer of buyers on top to drive things higher."

It\u2019s like when a weather man says its\u2019s going to snow, has all the science to show that it\u2019s going to snow, blasts all media that it\u2019s going to snow, and you just get flurries. Weather men are then very good at explaining why they were still correct, even though their prediction did not pan out. This is EXACTLY the same thing."

Sure there are those pulling 800% out of nowhere here and there, of those most of those fade right after, while the vast majority never blow and seem pretty much a dead end thus far. What doge have shown is consistency through time. Still you can always get lucky with one of those, but if is to gamble I rather go to wsb and lose money like a pro."

And if you, say, constantly threaten businesses and foreign countries with tariffs or other punitive actions, well, there\u2019s the motivation for them to pay you off. \n\nHeck, if I were a corrupt president, I\u2019d definitely be constantly threatening other countries with tariffs, and then when they paid me off, I\u2019d relax the tariffs. (Sound familiar?)\n\nGovernment should be set up so that politicians don\u2019t even have the \\*chance\\* to take bribes."

      "Bro, bonk guy is extremely legit ... *extreeeeemely legit*. I call him Uni, sometimes because i noticed many of his friends on CT did. He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"

Techdev highlighted the difficulty of maintaining 'diamond hands,' or strong risk tolerance, through Bitcoin's ups and downs. Many in the crypto industry agreed, noting that most early investors either sold too soon, lost access to wallets, or spent their Bitcoin. Holding long-term requires exceptional discipline and conviction.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

Traditionally, Bitcoin's price would peak post-halving, followed by a significant crash, but recent trends show deviations. Analysts suggest the cycle's predictability is diminishing, with reduced volatility and institutional investments stabilizing the market. Experts believe the era of 70-80% crashes may be over, replaced by milder corrections of 30-50%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Bitcoin is traded as an independent asset in the broader market, so its value fluctuates against other currencies/assets based on supply and demand. So yes, if the of USD entered hyperinflation, bitcoin price would appreciate against it because each new USD is now worth 90% less.\n\nOf course, the bitcoin price would also crash because the US is a huge percentage of the crypto market and that would be a huge loss in buying power.

      "Back in June, I kept receiving email and in-app notifications about how my web3 wallet funds in coinbase's then \"Wallet\" app needs to be moved into my main Coinbase balance due to upcoming upgrade. So I **followed the prompt in the Coinbase app to copy the address**, and sent over my eth (~0.4 eth) from my wallet in the then \u201cwallet\u201d app into \u201cCoinbase\u201d app. This transaction happened on July 3rd, and I confirmed it after* seeing balance appear in my main Coinbase app*, within the same week I came back to the app numerous times and saw balance each time i visited. I then forgot about i, since I don't really actively trade.\n\nThen fast forward to today, randomly i decide to check on the app with ETH going up and saw my balance is now showing 0. The source of the issue is that coinbase generates an address for transactions but the recipient address generated by Coinbase earlier is now for some reasons no longer tied to my account, and I can see on eth scanner that the same amount of eth is sitting in the same address, untouched.\n\nI then contacted Coinbase support, and was given some **very fishy** response: (**Case #24184256**):\n\n* First I was told that the reason why I am not seeing it is because of delay, as the \"transaction needs enough confirmation on the blockchain to be completed\". I responded that (1) there is no way an eth transfer takes more than 40 days to complete, (2) I already saw the balance in my Coinbase app before and (3) the transaction status is marked completed 39 days ago\n* After I pushed back, the agent responded by saying actually unfortunately the address is not tied to my account, I responded that this address is generated in Coinbase app and I clearly saw the balance before.\n* Then after 10 minutes, she said she \u201cchecked with the team\u201d and the address is actually still associated with my account, and it\u2019s just not visible for some reasons. I should just \u201cplease trust them I will receive the fund and I should just wait\u201d (after 40 days?)\n* I pushed back by saying I need an explanation as to why funds can just disappear from my account and addresses can just disconnect randomly, and an ETA on when this will be restored, i was then never given a response. Another agent then jumped in, I repeated the explanation but as she was investigating why this address got disconnected with my account, she promised she\u2019s getting an update, but suddenly force closed my case after 20 mins.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as I start to push back on the first agent, on help.coinbase.com/en page whenever the agent is active I kept getting forced logged out - every time a message pops up that requires me to respond, my response will be failed to sent and upon refresh it would show that I am logged out for some reasons. And while I was gone, the agent would ask many times whether I am still connected, as if she would like to see me disconnected to be able to close the case; when this was transitioned to a new agent, the issue disappeared.\n\nSince my case was force closed, I started another case #24185822, and was essentially given the same merry-go-around, oddly, the agent also disconnected while promising me she's looking into why this address got unlinked. And the subsequent agent was also not able to help. \n\nDue to how dodgy and inaccurate the responses were, I have two hypothesis:\n\n* **Customer Support Limitation** - the agents are either actually AI, or given too little access to tools, or under too much KPI pressure to provide actual help; i went through a total of 4 agents back to back, all of them would ask me the same type of basic questions or questions i've already answered. They were clearly outsourced and working on multiple cases at any given time. \n* **Potential Coinbase data breach / incident** - the account was generated by Coinbase, they still have fund custody in this address, there was no transaction at all on any associated accounts. If I were to guess this all points to either internal system failure - either a database system migration gone wrong or some security incident that caused them to lose address-to-account mapping for some customers, potentially tied to the whole migration associated with their wallet / base app. \n\n**Bottom line is this, before today, I did not even expect to face this type of issue with a publicly traded company I used to trust.** I was never expecting to tippy toeing on a \"legit\" platform like Coinbase, if things like this can just randomly happen without clear resolution and explanation, then their mission \u201cwe are deeply focused on solving our customers\u2019 problems with technology\u201d sounds very much like a joke and it\u2019s hard to separate them from any other smaller more suspicious exchanges. \n\nI have screenshots of all these conversations because it felt sus. Now I am out of options besides escalating this with their execs or government agencies, it absolutely sucks but I am just glad I didn't put my life savings or a larger investment on this platform, because now I sure as hell don't have the trust to do that."

These standards will serve as the baseline for a future licensing regime for standalone virtual asset custodians, aiming to foster a trusted digital asset ecosystem.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The difference is ICP was designed from the ground up to handle complex, compute-intensive applications on chain without offloading the core logic or state to a central authority. Its subnet architecture and orthogonal persistence let it scale while keeping the entire stack on chain and under decentralized governance. DFINITY is also actively working on roadmap milestones like Flux, Magnetosphere, and Solenoid to make ICP faster and more efficient while expanding decentralization at the same time. That is why it can run things like AI models or full web apps entirely on chain in practice, which no other major blockchain is doing."

      "BTCXAU-Chart suggests Bitcoin hasnt really approached a new ATH in adjusted terms. Of course one could also normalize for M2 supply but tbh, using the value of gold makes more sense because it better deflects on the market's perception of asset inflation.\n\nAs most of the times, BTC will take the path of most pain, which naturally is the path opposite to what most market participants expect. And the big narrative is: BTC is going to top in Q4 2025, then a bear market starts. This narrative was also present, but much more controversial in Q4 of 2021.\n\nThe longer we stay in the $110-120k area and the longer a sideway movement with low volatility, the more likely it is people lose faith and interest. This will eventually lead to a continuation of the bull market. If euphoria sets in because of stupid political shenanigans for example, a quick surge followed by a blow-off top become more likely. Altought right now, it certainly looks like the top is already in. But who cares, really? The year 2028 and especially 2032 and beyond is more more interesting."

They\u2019re not risk-free, but adoption is growing fast in payments, remittances, and retail, with services like [Rizon gift cards on CoinGate](https://coingate.com/gift-cards/rizon) showing real-world utility."

      "The stuff you mentioned is just scratching the surface honestly. I work at an engineering consultancy and we see this convergence happening in ways most people aren't thinking about yet.  \n  \nMEV protection is getting huge. AI models can predict and counter frontrunning attacks in real time by analyzing mempool patterns and transaction flows. Our clients building DEX infrastructure are using this to protect their users from sandwich attacks and other MEV extraction.  \n  \nCross chain bridge security is another area where AI makes sense. Training models on historical bridge exploits and transaction patterns to detect when someone's trying to manipulate oracle feeds or exploit timing differences between chains. The multichain world is creating attack vectors that humans can't monitor effectively.  \n  \nAutomated market making is evolving beyond simple algorithms. AI agents that can adjust liquidity provision strategies based on market volatility, gas prices, and even social sentiment. We've built systems that can pull liquidity during high volatility periods and redeploy when conditions stabilize.  \n  \nPrivacy preserving AI inference on blockchain data is interesting too. Using zero knowledge proofs to run AI models on encrypted transaction data without revealing the underlying information. Useful for compliance monitoring where you need to detect patterns but can't expose actual transaction details.  \n  \nDecentralized compute for AI training is getting traction. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers, distributing model training across blockchain networks. The incentive structures work well and it's more censorship resistant than traditional approaches.  \n  \nThe regulatory compliance angle is massive. AI systems that can automatically generate audit trails, detect potential violations, and even submit regulatory reports based on on chain activity. Our customers in DeFi are starting to need this as regulations get clearer.  \n  \nMost teams are still thinking about AI and crypto as separate domains but the real innovation happens when you architect them together from the ground up. The composability of both technologies creates possibilities that neither can achieve alone."

      "tldr; Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has proposed a major cryptocurrency tax reform to take effect in 2025. The plan includes reducing the tax rate on crypto gains from a maximum of 55% to a flat 20%, aligning it with traditional financial assets like stocks. It also aims to eliminate taxes on unrealized corporate crypto gains, reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products, and potentially approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. These changes, supported by the Liberal Democratic Party and industry advocates, aim to boost investment, foster innovation, and position Japan as a leader in digital finance.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

      "Oh god...\n\nSo, 'buying the top' refers to buying at the highest price in a market cycle. It has no where to go but down. Look at the charts, you see how they have peaks and valleys? You would be buying a peak right now, or, close to it. So next, is a valley. \n\nA buffered position in stocks is an investment strategy that uses options to limit a portfolio's potential losses, or \"buffer\" the downside, over a specific period. This downside protection comes with a trade-off: a \"cap\" on the maximum potential gains. This strategy is most commonly implemented through\u00a0buffered exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nFor example, I just put a bunch of money into a buffered position that is indexed to the SP500. The position has a 20% buffer, is capped at 10% gains, and matures in like 9 months. It was a 15 month contract. \n\nSo, if I hold for the full 15 months, and the index goes down 21%, I only lose 1%. However, if I don't hold it until maturity, I lose the full 21%. Now, if at any time, the position moves up 10% or more, I can sell it, take my profit, and buy into another buffered position. \n\nThis is a good strategy to get into a market that is really hot, maybe at, or near, ATH's. Does this all make sense? You are protected on the downside, but you've got to let the contract mature. If you hit your gains limit, you can sell it too. You don't need to hold it until maturity to take gains. You do need to hold it till maturity to get the downside protection though. \n\nThere is a new BTC buffered ETF that I believe just hit the market, or will hit the market soon. It offers downside protection, which, you might want if you'll be lumping in at the top of a market cycle."

You just want your statements to be taken at face value, but I am not sure that's so easy. \n\nThis is such a well-known and basic fact, that if you didn't know this then you know practically nothing about either Tether or Ethereum and I recommend shutting up about it so you don't embarrass yourself further. If you really need a fucking source, maybe check their own website: https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=usdt\n\nAs for their collateral, again this has nothing to do with anything but you keep yapping about it so I feel the need to point out that their bitcoin holdings is a tiny, tiny portion of their total collateral and it's absolutely not something they rely on. And for good reason, it is far too unstable and unreliable to serve as a collateral for a stablecoin, it would be gambling with their customer's money. If the customers needed to rely on bitcoin for their stablecoin to hold its value, then what was the point of the stablecoin in the first place? Nothing, obviously."

The experts say Trump's economic policies are the sole contributor to recession fears now,  and an article from 2020 also highlights the convergence of the 18 year housing bubble cycle aligning with it. \n\nMy understanding is that Trump wants to trigger the recession on purpose and that the high valuation of the markets leading up to the pop are simply people preparing for maximum rugpull. Prices are high,  retail and middle class have very little in the way of purchasing power. His entire crypto venture netted him about 2.5 billion in profit,  and he's never going to be satisfied.  \n\nTo him, crypto is a means to getting richer,  by devaluing the dollar which affects retail and middle class the most, and crypto was his way of parking his wealth until it's over."

The consensus rules still apply: an OP_RETURN output can only be up to about 10,000 bytes, a transaction up to about 100,000 virtual bytes, and blocks are still limited to about 4 megabytes weight.\n\nWhat changes is only the default relay policy. Nodes running Core will now forward larger OP_RETURN transactions by default. If you prefer the old behavior you can still turn off OP_RETURN relay or keep the old size limit in your settings. These options are being deprecated but they are still available in v30.\n\nRunning a pruned node also means you do not keep all historical block data forever, so you are not forced to store every piece of arbitrary content on disk. Bitcoin Knots uses stricter defaults for relaying, but just like Core it accepts all valid blocks under the consensus rules. Bitcoin is not suddenly becoming a storage chain, and users can choose how their own node handles data relay."

      "Working at a platform that designs decentralized and ML-driven systems and we've been helping clients build on Base since it launched. The technical fundamentals are solid but there are some real trade-offs to consider.\n\nBase is basically Coinbase's attempt to own the L2 narrative while keeping transaction fees reasonable. For developers it's pretty straightforward since it's just Optimism under the hood with Coinbase's infrastructure backing it. We've deployed smart contracts there for several customers and the developer experience is clean, gas costs are way lower than mainnet Ethereum, and bridging assets is smooth.\n\nThe real advantage is the Coinbase integration. If you're building something that needs fiat onramps or you want access to Coinbase's user base, Base makes sense. Our clients who are doing consumer-facing DeFi apps love that users can fund wallets directly from their Coinbase accounts without dealing with bridge complexity.\n\nThat said, the ecosystem is still pretty thin compared to Polygon or Arbitrum. Less liquidity, fewer established protocols, and you're basically betting on Coinbase's long-term commitment to the platform. We've seen companies get burned when centralized players change priorities.\n\nThe \"Everything App\" marketing is typical Coinbase overpromising. They're trying to be the WeChat of crypto but honestly most of our customers just use Base for specific use cases, not as some all-encompassing platform.\n\nFor newcomers, Base is actually pretty good because the Coinbase connection makes onboarding less of a clusterfuck. But if you're serious about DeFi or building complex applications, you probably want to start on mainnet or Arbitrum where there's more established infrastructure.\n\nSecurity reviews aren't optional if you're serious about scaling on any L2, but Base's architecture is battle-tested since it's just Optimism with different branding. The main risk is Coinbase-specific, not technical."

In reality, he is just keeping American investors safe, he doesn't have a single malicious bone in his body.\n\nHe sued/chased guys like Justin Sun, CZ, the XRP guys, USDT guys, Coinbase crew... all these enterprises are KNOWN to have grifter owners, known scammers, known criminals hiding behind their own countries broken law. \n\nDidn't you guys notice the uptick in Coinbase related victim posts where users complain about locked funds? How about Justin Sun's Tron that ONLY goes up and never goes down? How about the XRP centralization issues that have come to light recently? Whenever you read these kinds of posts, you go \"Yeye don't use Coinbase, scam platform\", but when Gary Gensler was targeting these bastards before he got fired, you were ridiculing him for gatekeeping crypto. He gets fired suddenly the fucking President is running a shitcoin, yet you monkeys are like \"???\".\n\nHe sued them, laid out EXACTLY why they are getting sued, what parts of their business practices are malicious etc. EVERY enterprise scam that is now coming to light, was already a part of Gary Genslers lawsuit back in the day.\n\nYet, you stupid idiots see this as gatekeeping, harming the crypto ecosystem. What a fucking joke you guys are really, get real."

      "???? Do you think that ETH sets its network parameters based on people voting with their ETH or something?????? How are you saying that control of ETH means control of how the network operates????\n\nDude it's exactly like Bitcoin where software developers and the community agree (WITHOUT USING CRYPTO) on what changes to make to the network. They then write code and update node/mining/staking software to reflect those changes and then the community must all decide to run the new software changes for the changes to take effect. The amount of BTC or ETH you hold has no bearing at all on what changes get agreed upon....\n\nYou know that Bitcoin has hard forks too right?? You know that a group of people control fundamental network properties of Bitcoin? https://www.investopedia.com/tech/history-bitcoin-hard-forks/\n\nIt's funny you bring up pre-mine because Satisho holds almost 2 million Bitcoin.... This is besides the point though because you seem to think control of supply equates to control of how the blockchain operates (hint: IT DOESN'T).\n\nYou really think that when you stake ETH on Coinbase nothing happens and you just reap the rewards? Bro come on. Coinbase runs validators and participates in PoS on your behalf. They validate transactions, they produce blocks, they attest to blocks. Validators run 24/7 and prevent any malicious activity on the network.\n\nPoW miners can repurpose their energy supply. They can repurpose their mining hardware (except ASICs). They can easily stop mining whenever they want and do something else. Miners can act maliciously and just walk away with no consequences. Look at the recent Monero attack. They're just going to re-purpose all their compute for other attacks or they'll just go back to mining legitimately. If PoS validators stop performing their services or act maliciously, they literally have their funds taken. And yes, miners are incentived to secure the network just like validators. What's your point?"

Neither of these 2 have broke those highs yet. I firmly believe we are in the disbelief part of the market cycle. Lot of short side liquidity up for grabs up to 124k. Billions worth/ mass adoption/mass buying from etfs/governments/companies. Study some comparisons of market sentiment/ behavior to roaring 20s/dotcom. Nobody truly knows how high it will go but never take all the chips off the table or you'll regret it for the rest of your life. I've been very vocal about this on X and see polar opposite sentiment blasted everywhere screaming for 95k and crashes all over. Quite intriguing the doubt the masses will have on a speculative asset as such. This market psychology dates all the way back to the \"tulip mania\" back in the day. More recently examples were Nvda. Been reading posts/sentiment about nvda since it was a few hundred billion dollar mc and look where it is at now.  I remain bullish with confirmation of this with a break over the listed highs on volume. Many folks line in the sand was 110k which was about 10% off the highs. Naturally market makers pulled it below to trap shorts and now it's running towards the next largest liquidity. Hope the offers some sort of help and congrats on the bags!"

That's not how it works or how it happened on any outage. Maybe you got tricked by the post that was literally one of the most upvoted posts in the history of the sub that claimed they had an on/off switch. Most networks can't operate if too much stake is offline, Solana is no different. Nothing related to the outage or the restarts can be attributed to centralization\n\n2. \"his devs\", by which I'm assuming you mean validators(which are not under Toly's control at all), would have to coordinate to restart any network. That's just social consensus 101. Even in the case of auto-restarts, validators would be coordinating their monitoring of the restart and may have manual changes needed.\n\n3. If there was a viable quantum threat present, then validators of *any* network likely would vote to pause until it was safe to relaunch with PQC upgrades.\n\n>It's not with concern trolling on blog slop posts that you solve problems.\n\nMaybe blame the authors who took it out of the long-form context where they sourced the quote. Maybe blame the interviewer who asked him about it.\n\nBut no, lets ignore that context and blame Toly for honestly answering a question he was asked on stage at a conference."

      "Tbh the recent liquidation cascade isn't really surprising if you've been watching the leverage data and on-chain metrics. Most retail traders were way over-leveraged going into this, and when BTC broke key support levels around 42k, it triggered automatic liquidations that created a feedback loop.\n\nThe underlying causes are pretty straightforward: too much borrowed money chasing the same assets, combined with macro headwinds like higher interest rates making risk off assets less attractive. Plus you've got the whole regulatory uncertainty thing with the SEC still being difficult about ETF approvals and exchange classifications.\n\nFor the 3-year outlook, I'm cautiously optimistic but not for the reasons most crypto bros talk about. The institutional infrastructure is getting way more mature. Our clients in the fintech space are finally building proper custody solutions and compliant trading systems instead of the sketchy shit we saw in 2017-2021. That's bullish for actual adoption vs just speculation.\n\nRegulatory frameworks are gonna stabilize whether crypto enthusiasts like it or not. The EU's getting MiCA implemented, and the US will probably follow with clearer guidelines once they stop treating every token like a security. This kills some of the Wild West excitement but makes institutional money way more comfortable.\n\nAs for specific coins, I don't really give investment advice, but from a technical perspective I'm watching projects that solve actual engineering problems. Layer 2 scaling solutions, privacy tech, and anything that makes DeFi actually usable for normal people instead of just degens.\n\nThe house buying story is cool but that was lightning in a bottle timing. These days you gotta think about crypto like any other emerging tech sector, not a get rich quick scheme. The real money is in building the infrastructure that makes this stuff actually work at scale."

(I could be wrong; I'm only cosplaying as a tax expert.) \n\nIf, as I suspect, it's not currently addressed in the tax code/rules then you need to decide if you want to be optimistic or pessimistic about how the IRS will treat these transactions in the event of a tax audit.\n\nThe optimistic approach is to believe \"wrapping\" and \"unwrapping\" are what they say they are; that is, you still own the Bitcoin while it's \"wrapped\" in a smart contract, so no disposition actually occurs and gain/loss isn't realized during these transactions.\n\nThe pessimistic approach is to treat \"wrapping\" and \"unwrapping\" as dispositions: realize your gain/loss whenever you TRADE Bitcoin for cbBTC (or whatever) because the wrapped token or contract is a DIFFERENT ASSET.\n\nIMO - and this is only MY opinion - it should really depend on what's actually happening when you say you've \"wrapped\" Bitcoin: did you lock it into a smart contract (i.e. it's the same instrument, still owned by you, just *encumbered* by the smart contract), or did you *exchange* Bitcoin for a token that claims to be equivalent in value to Bitcoin? If it's the former, I would argue that no disposition has occurred. If it's the latter, a disposition clearly occurred. \n\nIf you don't know the underlying mechanism by which how your Bitcoin is \"wrapped\", or if you don't want to risk losing this argument with the IRS in the event of an audit, my advice is to treat it as a disposition."

A bank is a systemic institution whose failure could trigger a financial crisis, which is why they get bailed out.\n\n\nAn ETF is just an investment product, it's nothing like a bank, If one fails, one investment fails, but the system doesn't break. There's no precedent or mechanism to bail out the shareholders of a single fund.\n\n\nIndividual investments fail all the time, they don't get bailed out.\n\n\nSecond, your fat finger scenario just makes my points even stronger. It would trigger a ruthless market correction, not a bailout. A massive, accidental trade would create the biggest arbitrage opportunity in history. The bankster class wouldn't be waiting for a phone call to Washington, they would be in a feeding frenzy to exploit the error and make billions, fixing the price in seconds.\n\n\nThe idea that they would all politely stop to help their biggest competitor is an absolute fantasy. They're rivals, literal direct competitors, they not friends, and the ruthless competition is what polices the system."

It was the number three altcoin at the time it wasn't picking from the bottom of the barrel it was a no-brainer. I would never buy cardano as it has not proved itself but then it was one of the top picks. The parabolic phase of the bull run has much Greater gains for alt coins. We are near the parabolic phase, or... it's not going to happen this time. Another way to look at it is 2021 Peak top 10 coins were all 30 billion to 60 billion. I would expect top 10 coins this cycle to be higher. Call it 50 billion to 100 billion and there should be 6 to 10 of those. SUI is currently 10 billion and I expected to be 50 billion plus if it's doing half of what they say it is. They're all ex Google Facebook tech leads. To say that only Bitcoin will be investable is actually saying you don't believe in cryptocurrency at all. How can you not see the entire world is waking up to the future of cryptocurrency right now, and then mistake that for being Bitcoin only.?"

These holdings are believed to originate from early mining activities between 2009 and 2010 and are associated with a distinct \"Patoshi Pattern.\" Despite the immense value, none of the coins have been moved since their creation, adding to the intrigue surrounding Nakamoto's identity and intentions. The dormant nature of these holdings has sparked speculation about whether the keys were lost or if Nakamoto intentionally chose to remain inactive to uphold Bitcoin's decentralized principles."

However, since 2020, the S&P 500 has underperformed Bitcoin significantly, with Bitcoin yielding a return of $1,473.87 on a $100 investment compared to $209.85 for the S&P 500. While the S&P 500 is a stable, low-risk index tracking 500 major U.S. companies, Bitcoin is a volatile, high-risk digital asset with different investment narratives. Bitcoin's recent surge highlights its growing appeal despite its smaller market cap and higher volatility.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

But I'm sure this will go lower again and again.\n\nIt's so fucking tiring guys. Uptober my ass. Everything is up, but barely any top100 coins. Even BTC. Okay it made like what, 10%. And now? NASDAQ , gold and Co are making these moves. AMD made a 20-30% move up. \n\nIt sucks. I really hope Q4 will blow up (otherwise this will be a year with zero euphoria??

No details whatsoever. Each one apparently had different shading in pastel colours for the circle, petals and background. The price for each was 0.1 Ethereum. Ker-ching!\n\nI hope you haven't lost much."

Not your absolute % nonsense not applicable in Wall St world (the one that hijacked your favourite coin). Now, learn math behind those calculations.\n\nLet's see, you're comparing asset (BTC) to index (SPY), so it's uninformed at best, and most likely disingenuous (just like Saylor's 60% CAGR when in reality it's been 10% since 2021).\nGiven that BTC is not a part of S&P, choosing it as benchmark will always put you in a good spot. But somebody else could point to, eg GREK or EPOL which outperformed BTC 2x this year. It also would be disingenuous. To each his own.\n\nNow, be honest and compare BTC to NVDA (leader to leader), or gold (SoV vs wannabe SoV), or to silver (similar market cap). Or compare it to vol-related stocks and their returns (implied vol, realized vol flatlined since April).\n\nNot to mention, you're probably operating using USD, look at BTC price action in stable currencies like CHF (or even EUR). It's abysmal.\n\nAnd don't talk about \"longer time horizon\" because the game has changed in November 2024 when IBIT options launched. That's the new era - era of \"shitty\" returns for BTC.\n\nYour narrative falls apart the moment you look at the data behind your favourite KOL's talking points.\n\nI'm done. Have a nice day :)"

In any case, I think we just disagree on how much or the degree to which institutions are willing to invest in alts, and how much retails actually has when it comes to invest in crypto (67% of americans are living paycheck to paycheck, up from 63% last year). So you can count them out. That's almost 70%. Then there's the remaining 30%. How much do they actually have to invest? Probably not too much on average, and if they do have some savings left at the end of the month, the majority of those 30% would probably put those couple of hundred bucks in a mutual index fund for stocks or the like. So yeah - I'm just not seeing it. And as you said - the market exists outside of the US, but the economic outlook isn't all that much better in Europe or Asia either. The macroeconomics is pretty bad overall in the world. One can say that the stock market is at an all time high, which it is, but that reflects the billionaires, whales, and people who rig crypto and the markets. It doesn't reflect the actual economy, at least if you ask me. The economy is more than the stock market."

Analysts point to bullish indicators, such as a MACD cross on the BTC/altcoins chart, hinting at potential altcoin growth.

      "Ok, so your BTC target is right in the middle of what I was saying. Basically, in a very bullish environment it could get close to 200k, but easily into your range. As far as I'm concerned, I'm really not that worried about BTC peak valuation, as I just buy and hold this asset for the long term. My strategy with it is completely different than with alts.\n\nETH at 6-7k is conservative and very realistic, but I definitely think there is a case for 8-10k. I think 10k+ for ETH only happens if BTC goes beyond 150k in a very bullish environment. In my personal opinion, I think those that invested into ETH this cycle are going to be very disappointed. When BTC was trading in the 16-40k range from spring 2022 through late 2023, ETH was spending most of that time around 2k. ETH was literally trading at .05 or more to BTC even until early 2024, when in the 2021 cycle it peaked around .085. It really didn't make any sense to buy ETH until this past April, when it tanked to 1400 at under .02 to BTC. In comparison, ETH bottomed out against BTC in late 2019. In my honest opinion, I'd rather just buy and hold BTC, though I did scoop up some ETH again this April at $1400.\n\n  \nAs for alts, I view these as more of a swing trade and not really something to hold for the long term. The top alts that we have now could be totally irrelevant by the next cycle. A good example I can think of is Bcash, it was a top alt in the 2017 cycle but then tanked horrendously into late 2018 and did ok in the 2021 run. Last cycle I dabbled in Bcash and LTC average entries at $200 and $40 respectively,, as well as ETH and BTC. I would have made more money if I had just stuck with ETH, though I did quite well with these 2 in 2021. This cycle my alt swing trade decision has been ADA, the bulk of my position was bought up in summer/fall of 2023 and fall 2024, with an average price around 34 cents. I basically loaded up at the bottom with regards to $ and especially with it's BTC pairing last fall, when it was under 700 satss to BTC. I actually thought about investing some $ into XRP last fall when it was at 50 cents, but after it rallied to $3 in November I didn't see the opportunity for gains."

I DCA anyway though but i am pretty certain the next 2 bull markets wont touch the sides on any previous bull cycle. \n\nJusy because of saturation theres so many meme coins now i just can't keep up. I do try tho. I hop skip jump one to next but deep down i know its waste of time. Bcos theres far too many cryptos now. \n\nBut that doesnt even matter anymore cos if sol dumps they all dump. If BTC gets hacked all bridges hacked too. Its just silliness. Pokemon cards are more valuable ther real. You can see its not scammed whilst you sleep. \n\nEven during economic stress Art always stays strong. Investment into art is safe. So pokemon cards are art pretty much.

      "\nMissed Bitcoin at $1? Here\u2019s Something Different\n\nMost of us have heard the stories about Bitcoin back when it was under a dollar \u2014 a time when almost nobody believed it would matter. That era is long gone, and no one expects it to come back. But there\u2019s a new project that\u2019s taking a similar path from the very beginning: **BC2 (Bitcoin II).**\n\nIt\u2019s built from the same base code as Bitcoin, using **SHA-256 Proof-of-Work**, the same **21 million limit**, and the same **halving schedule.** No meme branding, no shortcuts \u2014 just a clean restart of the original idea. Right now it\u2019s trading around $0.95, roughly the price of a coffee.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that BC2 isn\u2019t trying to replace Bitcoin or reach its price. It\u2019s not about competing \u2014 it\u2019s about revisiting what made the first network special in the first place: fairness, simplicity, and transparency. The community is small but active, with miners, developers and early holders helping shape the network from the ground up.\n\nEverything\u2019s transparent; you can check the explorer and live dashboard at bitcoin-ii.org. It\u2019s already listed on **CoinEx**, so it\u2019s more than just a whitepaper idea.\n\nNo one here is pretending this will become the next Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s not the goal. The point is to rebuild the same foundations, start fresh, and see what can grow when things are still open enough for individuals to make a real impact.\n\nbitcoin-ii.org"

Kind of implies he crashed the markets for them to buy at the bottom or something.\n\nAnyway, Trump isn't uniquely corrupt in this aspect, many of our politicians make absolute bank with straight up insider trading. Almost every President has come out of the position substantially richer. Obama 100x'd his net worth since taking office. Most of it was after office, but his campaign and presidency definitely didn't hurt his book sales. \n\nWhat Trump's doing with crypto is pretty shady, but it's not technically breaking the law right now. I think it's not as bad as some of the lawmakers that buy calls on something they are about to fund with a bill though. The people buying his crypto are willingly doing it and it has nothing to do with him using policy to manipulate it persay, just his enhanced credibility as the Pres... but he'd probably still have made a killing even if he did it between his terms."

Or locked them out of minimizing their downside potential by swapping to btc early on. \n\nAll the whinners never talk about what they're holding. That's cause their bag is full of dead meat."

A 4chan post that magically predicted the cycle top? Hahaha I know why you sold the 6th, because some neck beard believed in the 4 year cycle myth. Another magical indicator that has 0 relevance in the real world. It's almost like, hear me out, if you did actual research, you'd question why the 4 year cycle existed. Was it timing? Or was it liquidity? Was it fed policy? Was it the business cycle (ism)? It sure was. What happens when the fed changes things up? Oops. There goes your 4 year cycle timing. Seems like you'll have to go back to the drawing board \"bro\". Hfbp"

Good for institutional adoption and big money to enter. ***BUT***, it allows them to create a \u201cSynthetic Supply\u201d that they can then use to draw Liquidity from. They are then using that same liquidity against the market. Remember Friday before last? Big whales shorted the entire crypto market. They used the same liquidity that they are pulling from the ETFs to manipulate the market, and rinse out panic sellers. Some Alts were down 50%, this is not normal behavior. \n\nAlso when we allowed synthetics to play a part, they can create infinite synthetics. They make 10 BTC ETFs?

Factors such as spot ETFs, stablecoin inflows, and tokenized real-world assets are contributing to a more mature and stable market. Unlike previous cycles driven by hype, the next phase is anticipated to be fueled by real capital from traditional markets seeking stability and returns. Enhanced liquidity reduces volatility, making cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum more appealing as institutional-grade assets.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

And again, the biggest and most important thing (for HEGE specifically) Solana has is \"normie\" and retail acceptance for being a home of memecoins\n\nTrump actually is a rug-puller, so I won't argue with you on that point.

You cannot produce blocks without investing wealth. If you invest wealth, your block production will scale with the amount of wealth you invest.\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"faster upgrades\".\n\nI don't know why people need to spin myths about PoW and PoS when they are very simple (and very similar) mechanisms."

      "Hey mate, I want to jump in on this too because I am also looking into this stuff and also had a post removed from r/Bitcoin pertaining to this issue which sucks.\n\nThere are a few proposals for updating the bitcoin software for quantum-safe but there are a few caveats:\n\n**2 options:**\n\n1) Freeze (block transactions) on wallets using old pre-quantum keys to prevent future quantum 'bounties'.\n\n2) Allow old wallets that can't migrate due to lost keys to remain active but susceptible to stealing.\n\nIn both cases there are drawbacks. \n\nIn the first option it would mean some people who genuinely lost their keys can't migrate and thus lose funds forever. One of the bitcoin devs on the mailing list says we could allow frozen wallets to be recovered using the seed phrase as an option.\n\nSecond option would mean a quantum hacker could steal keys and potentially liquid them quickly, causing massive loss in faith as well as market chaos.\n\n**There is also another caveat to both options** \\- the need to migrate wallets to post-quantum encryption which would mean a transaction on the chain for every wallet that requires migration. Considering the current throughput of bitcoin chain at around 7 transactions per second this would result in significant network usage.\n\nI am tempted to propose that we have special migration blocks that would allow a larger block size to increase throughput on migration transactions."

      "People thinking Crypto will save anything are not seeing the reality. I got into it during COVID, but quickly realised that most of the crypto world (and NFTs) is about making 10X, 100X etc... Basically chasing the exact same thing money and stock market does, only amplified.   \nHowever, thinking you're on a revolutionary and free platform, you tend to forget that it comes with the problems of such a thing. No insurance, no regulations etc... \n\nFor one poor dude that became \"rich\", how many more rich dude became richer ? Who is losing all that money that makes people go 10X and 100X ? Guys like you ! And guys like me. Or could've been me, but I just realised that's not a game I'm willing to play. The theory of crypto was good, the reality of it is a joke.\n\nActing like it's gonna save and free people, when all you really want is to 100x, dismissing the conflicting truth that if you do make 100x, it means you ruined poor mofos that trusted lies too.\n\nJust look at YT bro. For the past 6 years it's the same exact clickbait title over and over, it's just like those YT adds trying to sell you courses, claiming you'll make 10k per month doing nothing.\n\nThe moment dogecoin became more than a meme, there was no question about the seriousness of it all in my mind. It's just a big gamble, that you're likely to lose :)"

They are just confident they can get a better one.\n\nYou say \"I want this stock for $100 a share\". \n\nRobinhood says, \"Sure you got it!\"\n\nThey then sell the order to a prop trader and say \"We'll give you $99.99 for one share\" -- Robinhood pockets the one penny\n\nThe prop trader has high frequency algorithm magic and goes out an buys the share for $99.98 and pockets another penny.\n\nYou still get your share for $100. That was the market price during that precise moment in time when you hit the \"buy\" button. It just wasn't the market price in the 100 milliseconds *after* you hit the button.\n\n  \nRobinhood is not a moral structure -- it's a profit driven corporation. Trading stock requires back-end infrastructure and computers and regulations. Someone has to pay for it. You used to pay for it with a commission. Now you pay for it with order flow. \n\nI'm not saying it's right, but it's clearly what most consumers want since basically no one charges commission fees anymore. I agree that there should be regulations on payment for order flow, like making sure the \"market price\" you're seeing is the same as what the market maker sees. But, ultimately, professionalized traders with sophisticated algorithms and computers hooked directly into the stock trading platforms are always going to have an edge, especially on the sub-second timescale."

Real communities and committed whales are the only true moat.\n\nThe problem is, most platforms like Pump.fun are built for the pump, not for the long-term survival you're describing. They provide a launchpad but no infrastructure to maintain that crucial community focus and engagement over time.\n\nThis is exactly why I've been looking at @LunarPumpFun. It's the first platform built from the ground up to solve the \"what after the launch?\" problem. It provides the tools for a meme to build a sovereign, sustainable economy:\n\n\u00b7 Permanent Communities: The community page, chat, and live stream are permanent. This is the \"home\" that prevents a community from losing focus and dissolving. It's where the real culture and loyalty are built.\n\n\u00b7 Two-Way Tipping: This creates a real-time circular economy between creators and holders. It rewards active participation and gives whales another way to engage and show support beyond just holding, strengthening their commitment.\n\n\u00b7 Sustained Engagement: Features like the official \"Moon or Dust\" game show act as a built-in engagement engine, providing organic, recurring exposure to help patiently wait for and attract that retail capital.\n\nA meme like $MOMO with strong technicals, combined with a permanent home on LunarPumpFun, would be a formidable combination. It's the ultimate validation of your thesis.\n\nFrom my perspective, the real asymmetric bet isn't just finding the next $MOMO, but in the platform token $INF that powers this entire ecosystem of sustainable communities, currently valued at a fraction of its predecessors."

      "Doge and Shib had massive amounts of money coming from regular people. In fact, most crypto natives massively dismissed both coins and were in disbelief as how high they went - that cycle was still for the majority CT natives about \u201cthe tech\u201d (think new L1s like Sol, Avax,  Matic, BNB) and DeFi. There were plenty of memes as well, but it was niche, not consensus.\n\nNothing has brought in significant new liquidity outside of institutions and crypto natives. In fact, most regular people have stayed away completely this cycle because they were burnt by the last.\n\nIf any project manages crack the code and package things up in a way that feels new/different (e.g. something more akin to GME) then you\u2019ll see very different price action - and I believe that is already taking hold with a certain coin."

The strategy is to find the coin with the most diehard community and SPX is quite simply the best. Come see it for yourself and gain your own conviction. Buy a coin and come hang out in Spaces on X, watch Flipping the Stock Market podcast on Apple, Spotify, etc. There is a book written about SPX as well, on Amazon. Murad's Token 2049 talk is also well worth watching: [https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=-iareDdfHHmNprun](https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=-iareDdfHHmNprun) SPX is his favorite of course.

The \"digitizing the stock market\" is too big of a thing, even if it ends up vaporware.  It's a good story.\n\nI missed the boat on alts, I missed the boat on MSTR.  BMNR is Tom Lee's ETH treasury company and, if we're about to have any sort of mania or leg-up, I expect the story/hype/euphoria to find its way there pronto.  The dude has been shilling BTC and ETH daily on the bloomberg channels and, frankly, he's great at it.  Having made the correct bullish calls these past 6 months doesn't hurt either.\n\nI'm a story guy.  This is a good story.  It will resonate with \"the people\", so I'm in.\n\nGoing forward, I believe there will be exactly two winners in this space; BTC and ETH.  BTC because trustless, scarce digital gold.  We all know why.  ETH because it's the backbone for all the defi, stablecoins, fancy schmancy stuff that's yet to come.  All others go to zero IMO.\n\nI have never been able to reconcile the enormous supply of ETH and why it should have value; it's much more straightforward with BTC.  Nevertheless, I'm going to stop overthinking it and accept that I simply think it's going up from here."

Bringing manufacturing back will increase costs because wages will of course be higher than the countries we import from. The factories that we might build will cost many multiples what the cost overseas because of our environmental laws too.\n\nAll of these things will cause inflation which I\u2019ll prevent rates from being able to be cut. If trump replaces the fed board with lackeys then the currency will get destroyed instead. \n\nNone of these things are good. The actual best course of action would be to stop doing tariffs so that inflation can come down then we can lower interest rates.

Then you can leverage BTC even more which will continue until hyperbitcoinization. \n\nBasically BTC up leverage ratio goes down and you can leverage up again and again up to safe leverage ratios.\n\nNot to mention as MSTR goes up it gets more passive flows from indices leading to even more capital to buy BTC via ATM and increase the base BTC even more enabling further leverage. \n\nSo 10 years of 30% CAGR in BTC and debt at an average of 8% let's them grow their assets base 22% a year. \n\nThe amount they can grow depends on how much Capital they can raise via debt. They are primarily targeting the bond market and the money market categories. 1% of 300T ie 3T to buy BTC can definitely do the job. Let's say 1M BTC is 10 years away. They buy at an average price of 500k. That's 2M more BTC over 10 years.. \nThe limiting factor will be that they can't lever up past 50%."

Saving a few thousand more in case it tanks because I think you're wrong and we're going to continue to see it drop more than you're expecting so I want to keep a little extra money on the side to average down further if it does drop more. Suggest you do the same, don't put everything you have in right now even though you think it's about to Moon. I sure hope at moons that would be great but I'm just saying if you're a little off with your timing you should keep a little money on the side don't go all in just yet okay?"

      "- We're likely to peak in October, historically speaking if looking at post BTC halving to peak time.\n\n- strong institutional demand/ ETF inflows\n\n- weakening dollar \n\n- usdt dom dropping \n\n- truflation is dropping \n\n- softening us economy \n\n- stock market still going strong\n\n- 90+% chance of fed rate cut incoming \n\n- US president's office is crypto friendly, as well as the SEC now. Even the legislative branch has passed some crypto bills on stable coins. 50% of stable coin market built on ETH.\n\n- Eth leads alt coins seasons. \n\nSeems like the perfect storm for a strong price discovery for eth and so probably alt coins too. Especially L2s on ETH.\n\nBut I'm also thinking this time is different. Fomo retail has been burned, probably twice now for coming in late and been left holding the bag for months or years. Only recovering fully very recently if they held through it all. They may not come back in the same way as before but who knows. \n\nWe're getting close to ath so nearly all eth holders are currently in profit. That's a lot of selling pressure about to hit soon as well. If eth comes down, alts are probably coming down hard too."

      ">You read articles, and take is as truth. You are weak minded. Think for yourself.\n\nIt is not an article, is me replying to someone with the same arguments you present.\n\n>Bitcoins security in the far far future ( why it's silly to call this a crisis) does spark debate within the community and has for many years. The question of what will happen when the block subsidy stops or becomes incredibly small, who will support and secure the network? As the subsidy becomes smaller, transaction fees will have to take a larger roll. There are many cases made where this could easily be the case and work out, there are cases that prove otherwise. I for one think fees can contribute enough but this is not just a black and white situation with a yes or no answer. This goes beyond you eth maxis. This answer also heavily depends on the price and adoption of Bitcoin in the far future. To say it's already failed is so incredibly naive.  \n\nTX fees are 1% of current issuance. \n\nYou understand that even if BTC reacts, it can only do what ETH has already done. It can only play catch-up. Both chains have to pay for security, pretending you can stop printing is just not possible - so your best bet is minimal viable issuance, which is to say you always pay for security, but then any time you have fees, you can offset it with burn. The fact that Ethereum already did this is why it is a better a SOV. **It does not need to change, while Bitcoin does.** \n\n**\"Having an uncertain monetary policy is not a good one\" - EXACTLY.** You even misunderstand WHY it is good - being changeable is not the problem - that is in fact optimal, as long as the social contract is that you only change the issuance DOWN, i.e. make the monetary policy BETTER. \n\nOn top of that, even if it changes, as I have already said, POW requires more subsidy; you have to pay electricity and hardware costs of miners, or they won't mine. This is much less capitally efficient than POS - it is both less secure and less scarce than Ethereum is, and that will forever be the case.\n\nYou've been lied to, DYOR."

      "It is quite simple. Now we have stablecoins like EUROC that are provided by circle. The problem is that the prpmise of value (that the EUROC is worth exactly one euro) depends solely on Circle. If they go down or they do something shady or they have some problems the EUROC might lose its peg.\n\nWhat digital Euro has to offer is that it won't be pegged to 1 Euro. It will be 1 Euro. Whatever happens it will be worth 1 Euro by law. Just like cash - whatever happens on the world your 5 Euro bill will be worth 5 Euro\n\nSo as I understand it for now the biggest advantage is the stability and peace of mind.\n\nAlso a lot of people talk about the privacy and freedom concerns. Those are valid points but on the other hand we now have Circle that controls everything that is happening with your USDC and EUROC. They can (and I am sure they do) track how you use your coins and block some actions that they don't like. So to be honest I might even prefer ECB over some private company when it comes to who can control my money"

Price is not moving up and even though there will be a huge adoption because of StableCoins (Genius ACT, Digital Euro) it still doesn't make a lot of sense to consider it an investment. The same way as you can't consider holding Cash an investment. I don't see people going and buying tons of USD or Euro and calling it an investment. It's just cash. Somehow most crypto bro's like you prefer to call people stupid instead of looking into why crypto is a Ponzi scheme.

Probably worth at least $20 in craftsmanship by itself. \n\nIt's beautiful, it's fun, it's got sort of similar vibes to a \"challenge coin\" \n\nI'm assuming the \"Finite By Design\" is the coin manufacturer's brand, and not supposed to be a reference to ETH."

So if the price crashes, I can close both the short and long positions whenever I want.

If I close both trades now, I would have about the same loss I\u2019d have had with a stop loss. but now, I can choose to take profit from the short order and wait for the price to go back up if I believe it will.\n\nYou might say I\u2019d need margin for both orders, but I can use high leverage with this method. Even with 50x leverage, I wouldn\u2019t get liquidated using this method.\n\nI\u2019m new to trading and wondering: what\u2019s the problem with this approach? It played out so far well."

Held Sui for a while, but I see that when the market crashed that it was time to short it...and I didnt get to buy it under 2..So I'm out. There is too many coins now and not enough liquidity to pump the whole altcoin market up at the same time - unless we have a huge crash. Which technically isnt alt season but a rebounce.

      "This isn't as cracked up as it sounds. I've had a Gemini card for like three months now. They offer XRP as rewards and like 20 other cryptos to choose from. It's also a mastercard so no idea why people are making a big deal out of this new \"XRP Card\" when it's ran by Gemini anyway.\n\nYou're better off just getting a Chase card or something like that and just straight up buying XRP with another account. The Gemini app is pretty terrible. It does a TERRIBLE job at showing you basic information about your credit cards account. I still can't change my rewards back to XRP for two weeks now...the app simply just does not work correctly.\n\nI'll be locking my card and hiding it in my house somewhere simply to keep the credit on my account. If you do get this card just use it for gas as that gives the most rewards. Also what they don't mention flat out is that the rewards are capped at 300 dollars worth of crypto rewards per month. They can also close out your account for literally no reason, it's in the fine print. Do some searching, there's plenty of posts of people having thousands to tens of thousands of money locked up in an account they can't access and Gemini won't do anything about it."

The entire process is enforced by the XRP Ledger's code and is publicly auditable on the blockchain. This means Ripple cannot arbitrarily release more XRP than the programmed schedule allows. The only reason we even know that is because of how transparent they are. \n\nThey understand the spirit of decentralization, and thats obviously a target they aim to hit over time as escrow drains, but their main priority at the time was to facilitate instantaneous low-cost transactions. That required a pre-mined coin when they built the ledger. They came up with the escrow idea to make it transparent what they were doing because you shrills were bitching about centralization back then too. It becomes more decentralized over time.\n\nThe coin has seen more growth in value in the last year than almost any other cryptocurrency on the market, yet you doubt its ability to hit valuations it was engineered to reach. That's ridiculous. But hey, I get it: nay-saying is risk-free."

This requires tons of legal frameworks to be established, which takes time. It is also a huge process for a business to restructure their entire finance departments to use XRP instead of what they\u2019re using.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle investing in a legitimate business, then look up meme coins and become a gambler. Investing isn\u2019t just making your money miraculously grow. You actually need the businesses you invest in to make the business moves day in and day out. When you invest in Google, do you think your investments just miraculously grow? No. Every day, tens of thousands of Google employees, representatives, sales people, and lawyers are out there hauling ass to make business moves that grow the value of the company."

      "Okay! Let\u2019s say you want to buy $50,000 of something called XRP, but you don\u2019t want to buy it all at once. Instead, you want to spread it out over time, like buying a little bit of candy each week instead of a whole big bag at once. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging, or DCA. It\u2019s a smart way to buy things like XRP because the price can go up and down a lot, and this helps you avoid buying when it\u2019s super expensive.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it, super simple:\n\n1. **Pick a Plan**: Decide how much time you want to spread your $50,000 over. Let\u2019s say you want to buy over 10 weeks. That means you\u2019ll spend $5,000 each week ($50,000 \u00f7 10 = $5,000).\n\n2. **Choose a Place to Buy**: You need a special app or website called an \u201cexchange\u201d to buy XRP, like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. It\u2019s like a store for digital money. You sign up, add your bank card, and you\u2019re ready to go!\n\n3. **Set a Schedule**: Every week (or month, or whatever you pick), you buy $5,000 worth of XRP. For example, every Monday, you log in and buy $5,000 of XRP, no matter if the price is high or low.\n\n4. **Buy the XRP**: When you buy, the exchange will tell you how much XRP you get for your $5,000. If XRP costs $0.50, you\u2019d get 10,000 XRP ($5,000 \u00f7 $0.50). If the price changes to $0.40 next week, you\u2019d get 12,500 XRP for the same $5,000. Cool, right?\n\n5. **Keep Going**: Do this every week for 10 weeks. By the end, you\u2019ll have spent $50,000 and own a bunch of XRP. Since you bought at different prices, you won\u2019t lose as much if the price drops, and you\u2019ll still do great if the price goes up!\n\n6. **Store It Safely**: After buying, keep your XRP safe in a \u201cdigital wallet,\u201d like a special app or device, so nobody can take it.\n\nThat\u2019s it! By buying a little each week, you\u2019re being super smart and safe with your money, like saving up your allowance for a big toy. Want me to explain anything else?"

There's a 1% fee for selling and trading but Robinhood has a 0.85% charge and whatever you gain will be a taxed so to avoid that all together, a ROTH IRA is my suggestion.\n\nThere you can also expand your portfolio so XRP isn't the only Crypto guy can purchase.

Im assuming OP is on the green but negligibly so. Also if youre new bro(OP), use limit sells cus fuck the market prices when they snip half your profit if you aren't paying attention to what youre selling. Factor that into whatever you're selling, whether it be stock or crypto. The limit sell button is on the top right when selling just in case you didn't know(not presuming)"

A few minutes laterI was able to buy at $2.49. Hours later it stayed around $2.37 and I bought more. This was basically a coordinated effort by exchanges (Binance and Bybit had the lowest rates for a short time) and probably whales to flush out both leveraged long and short positions as well as panicked retail investors. It worked unfortunately. I lost on all my alt-coins yesterday, but didn\u2019t sell anything. I\u2019m holding on for the long term so I bought more of my top coins last night while prices were still low."

The graph only has so much resolution and that resolution decreases on larger time scales. In addition systems like this will also roll up averages on historical data quite often to save space. There are ways you can save space and still keep track of extreme data points but those would have to specifically be accounted for in the algo. For example you could say keep track of the lowest price in a 5 min window or keep track of the highest price in a 5 minute window.\n\nAll this to say that I highly doubt some engineer at kraken was told to go erase or change data points. Likely the algo they are using just doesn't account for visibility into flash crashes over longer windows."

      "With that 7,000 XRP you're in the top, something like 5% of people in the world who own XRP. I'm in my 60's and I've been involved in both crypto in general, and XRP specifically, since 2014/15.\n\nI got into crypto BECAUSE OF XRP to begin with. Funny thing is, back then in order to buy ANY XRP you had to 1st buy Bitcoin \ud83e\udd23. THEN you had to open an acct thru Coinbase (iirc) and a final one via Binance. At the time, Coinbase hadn't yet listed XRP on its platform. So, you had to buy Bitcoin (didn't matter from whom/where) then you had to convert the Bitcoin to another coin ( I THINK it was ETH, but I'm not sure now) and then you used the ETH to purchase XRP from Binance. \n\nWhen I think of all the Bitcoin I once HAD just so I could BUY XRP!! \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd23 \n\nHad I been able to see into the future... I'd have just kept the Bitcoin and FORGOTTEN about buying XRP!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nThat's on, though. By approx 2020/21 I had nearly 100,000 XRP. I had won a couple of law suits and had used some of the monies I received to buy as much XRP as I could. But THEN, around that same time period Bitcoin (and I think the market in general) took a header and dropped in value like a rock. Not too long previously, it had hit an ATH of approx $64,000.  So, when it dropped all the way down to $20,000 and looked like it was going to fall even further, I was DETERMINED to NOT miss out on my opportunity to buy Bitcoin in WHOLE coins instead of just little pieces and parts of one. I'd  missed out on  being able to buy it when it FIRST came out because I knew of NOBODY who A) owned a computer and, B) knew how to buy crypto ON the damn thing, either. So I had just given up and figured I'd \"circle back\" to it one day. Well, here was my day. \n\nSo, I traded some of my XRP for some Bitcoin's and I haven't regretted it for a moment. I now own Bitcoin at an average cost of $5,000 per and they're now worth over $100,000+ each and, I own a decent amount of XRP as well as approx 8 other coins (remember, never put all of your eggs (read:crypto) in the same basket. Diversification is our friend)\n\nBest of luck to you and I hope all of your crypto dreams come true. Perhaps I'll see you on your way to the moon...and beyond? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf12\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\ude90\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u2728\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80..??\nS"

      "It\u2019s a good amount. If it\u2019s $50 in 10 years that\u2019s 350k.  Good start to retirement. \nTry the Gemini xrp credit card. Good way to passively stack your xrp as rewards\n\nCold wallets are best though. Look into ledger. It\u2019s the safest option. Coinbase isn\u2019t going anywhere but you never know with others. FTX won\u2019t be the only one to fail. \n\nYou can\u2019t stake xrp though\n\nFYI in ledger you can trade and stake some assets. You can get good yields for usdc. Might want to consider selling some of your XRP when you think we hit the top of the cycle. If it gets to six bucks, sell 30 or 40% and hold it in USDC for a year and gain interest in it. Buy back in xrp with it when it drops back down to two dollars. Then you have more and it might go up to 10 or 25 next cycle.\n\nRemember, so far crypto markets are cyclical. It might not be like that forever but so far that\u2019s what you can expect. It goes up and then it goes down and then it goes up higher than it goes down less than last time.  If you try to time it a little bit, you can exponentially increase your assets."

Supply and demand.  Supply economics are complicated in crypto because it's highly fragmented, but it's a critical metric.  The MAIN reason BTC is so expensive is because of its scarcity.  ETH has numerous variables that affect supply economics: ETH locked in Staking, lost ETH, and, of course, ETH holders.  How much supply is in exchanges/OTC exchanges is what determines price. \n\nIf ETH hits $1 trillion market cap it will be over $8k.  Is this doable?

Disclaimer: I hold Keeta, so dyor.\n\nHere is my shill:\n\nKeeta\u2019s protocol stack is designed as a compliance-native, high-throughput, Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Layer 1 optimized for regulated asset issuance and settlement.\n\n\u2022\tConsensus Layer: Implements a deterministic quorum-based BFT model requiring \u2265 2/3+1 validator voting power for block finality. This design preserves safety under validator churn and partial network faults while maintaining sub-second deterministic finality in optimal network conditions.\n\n\u2022\tScalability Architecture: Employs parallelized transaction execution with ordered commit protocols, allowing disjoint transaction sets to be processed concurrently while retaining a unified global state root. Avoids traditional sharding pitfalls such as cross-shard messaging complexity or security dilution.\n\n\u2022\tAnchor Subsystem: Anchors are protocol-level primitives that perform asset custody, off-chain verification, and on-chain token issuance/redemption. Asset state is cryptographically bound to custody attestations, enabling provable 1:1 backing for RWAs and fiat representations.\n\n\u2022\tCompliance Integration: Identity attestations and rule sets for KYC, AML, and FATF Travel Rule compliance are enforced at the transaction layer, ensuring that all protocol interactions can meet jurisdictional regulatory requirements without third-party middleware.\n\n\u2022\tInteroperability Layer: Native cross-chain messaging and settlement pathways allow anchors and participants to bridge assets between Keeta and external L1/L2 ecosystems, providing interoperability without external bridge contracts as single points of failure.\n\n\u2022\tTokenomics & Supply Mechanics: $KTA features deterministic emission schedules with programmed supply compression events, creating periodic liquidity constraints (\u201csupply shocks\u201d) that can amplify demand pressures in adoption phases."

      "To the best of my knowledge, HOME works differently from most crypto. Instead of following the ups and downs of Bitcoin or Ethereum, its value comes from a bunch of real-world mortgages. It\u2019s essentially like a REIT (real estate investment trust) version of crypto, moving more like slow, steady housing debt than the highly volatile crypto market.\n\nThe risk is you are trusting a small team to manage those mortgages, collect payments, and handle any defaults. If the housing market tanks, people stop paying, or the loans are not as solid as advertised, the backing for the token takes a hit. It is kind of like a mini version of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from the 2008 crash. Back then, bad or risky loans were bundled together, sold as safe, and when the housing market went south, the whole thing collapsed.\n\nThe mortgages are tied to the cryptocurrency through the protocol\u2019s structure. When investors buy HOME with stablecoins like USDC, that money is used to fund or refinance real-world home loans. Those loans are secured by liens, which are legal claims on the properties. The details of those liens and the cash flow from mortgage payments are managed on a blockchain.\n\nIn short, each token represents a share of a pool of mortgages, and the blockchain serves as the ledger that tracks ownership and payouts. As long as the underlying mortgages remain solid and the housing market stays stable, the structure can work as intended."

Also just look online for the 4 year cycle, no one really is sure itll always happen but its good to read about it, basically its the idea of capital rotating from BTC to ETH to smaller and snaller cap coins. Good luck bro, dont put too much money into it and dont get greedy and you shall be good."

Do not sell the dips. Timing the market is impossible. People that say that they can are lying. Markets are level 2 chaos systems. Predictions change the outcome.\n\nNext learn about what a clearing house is. That is what a blockchain solves in a decentralized manner. Once you understand that you will see clearly as to why bitcoin is going to be taking over.\n\nNext learn about private keys, how to store them securely. If you get 3x more than a hardware wallet is worth, get one. Because soon that 3x number is going to turn into a 100x number.\n\n  \nThen understand the data structure of bitcoin. Why sha256 is secure and why proof of work works.\n\nThen learn why bitcoin is a protocol and why the world only needs one blockchain. Just like the world needs one internet.\n\nThen you will sleep soundly.\n\nGetting into bitcoin requires you to learn a few skills, but anyone can get into the basics.\n\nAvoid the pump and dump schemes. This space is rife with scoundrels promising quick returns.\n\nWelcome to the future."

SOLUTION - either you should do marketing for your coin launch, you must be able gather people to show interest and build hype for launch. or next option is to use bundler tool and volume tool which gives intial pump and chart push. Well from here if coin hits certain and market cap and finishes bonding curve it will be migrate to Dexscreener.\n\n2 Dex Launch without Migration :\n\n\\- well you can use third party launchers ( DYOR , lot of drainers ) , where you can launch directly onto dex , after creating coin on third party tool, you can add initial liquidity , the moment you add liquidity , a price will be set and coin can be started trading. Again you can use marketing for promotion or any other volume or bundler tools for initial price push and volume push.  \n  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like I was saying\u00a0I have done this before, I started with $250, I waited for a snipe for a potential 100+Mkc coin to appear(many come out every 10- 20 minutes) I seen one, checked for safety/narrative/and placement,\u00a0 funneled a $50 before the coin 4x'd I managed to take out profits near the peak which is severely risky and not recommended but aye, we ball.

Like, Bitcoin ETFs are already a big deal\u2026 but an ETH ETF that actually pays out staking rewards? That feels like a whole different level of regulatory challenge.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious what people here think:\n\n* Do you think the SEC will ever allow an Ethereum ETF that distributes staking rewards? Or is that a step too far for them?\n* And if something like BlackRock or Fidelity actually launched one, would it kill DeFi staking (since institutions could stake \u201csafely\u201d), or would it onboard a completely new class of investors into ETH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What i have been doing the last 10 years is look at projects that are actually going to make something and provide value. Sure you can make alot of money with some meme coin but this is like gambling. Find a project you are interested in and figure out what they are doing, how they are doing it, when they are going to be able to deliver their product. Get in touch with devs via telegram or whatever channel they use. The devs want you to invest so always take what they say with a grain of salt but there are a couple of projects that are actually trying to be legit and these could deliver great returns but its definitley not short term. You want to hop in early as one of the first and keep in touch with the community to see where its heading."

They hold billions in reserves, but users have to trust corporate custodians, attestations, and opaque banking relationships.\n\nNow Avalanche has introduced **AUSD**, the **first fully DAO-governed stablecoin**. Here\u2019s what makes it different:\n\n* **Community governance:** Parameters like collateral ratios and accepted assets are set by DAO votes, not corporate executives.\n* **Over-collateralized:** Every $1 AUSD is backed by at least $1.50 worth of crypto.\n* **On-chain audits:** Reserves are transparently visible and updated in real time.\n* **Avalanche speed:** Built on AVAX, the system benefits from fast finality and low fees.\n\nThis could be a game-changer for DeFi. Instead of trusting a company in New York or offshore, users can trust code and community governance.\n\nOf course, questions remain: Can AUSD scale enough to challenge USDT/USDC? And how will regulators respond to a stablecoin with no centralized issuer to subpoena?\n\nFull deep dive here \ud83d\udc49 [hodlhorizon.com/news/dao-stablecoin-launch-avalanche](https://hodlhorizon.com/news/dao-stablecoin-launch-avalanche?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 is DAO governance the future of stablecoins, or will regulators crush this before it gains traction?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "in short, yes. crypto is one of the most important unlocks for humanity this century. the ramifications of decentralized systems being widespread is still not yet fully understood and things are going to be weirder than you could possibly imagine. ask yourself, if crypto wasn\u2019t worth it then why did every government in the world try so hard to kill it since it came into existence? i can assure it is not \u201cfor your protection\u201d it is for their protection, more specifically protecting their tenuous grasp on power. it takes time to internalize this so my main recommendation would be to find communities that teach about these cypherpunk values and get involved! one of the biggest and fastest growing communities like this is r/spx6900. obvs im biased but i really think that not only is buying $spx the best move especially if you\u2019re just looking to buy a bit every week or so, but it is also the most important movement happening in the world rn. we will change the world, i hope you join us"

      "The fact that you\u2019re asking that question probably means your gut is picking up on something. When projects look like they\u2019re \u201cabout to moon,\u201d it\u2019s usually either a legit narrative run or the setup for a classic rug. The hard part is telling which is which in the moment.\n\nA few red flags I personally watch for:\n\n* **Liquidity depth**: If volume is spiking but liquidity is shallow, insiders can pull the plug easily.\n* **Token distribution**: Heavy concentration in a few wallets = big risk.\n* **Dev/Team transparency**: If nobody knows who\u2019s behind it or the roadmap is just memes, tread carefully.\n* **Utility vs hype**: Narrative pumps can make money, but long-term survival comes from actual use cases.\n\nAt the same time, sometimes the sketchy coins do moon short-term. It just comes down to whether you\u2019re trading or investing. If you\u2019re trading, set stops and don\u2019t marry the bag. If you\u2019re investing, make sure the fundamentals line up with your thesis.\n\nOn a practical note, if you\u2019re worried about getting stuck in one ecosystem when chasing plays, multi-chain swap tools like Rubic make it easier to hop in/out across chains without being tied down to sketchy bridges. That\u2019s saved me a couple of times when hype tokens only existed on one network.\n\nIf you do ape in, maybe size it like it\u2019s already lost. That way you\u2019re not wrecked if it rugs. Do you see this as a short-term gamble, or are you actually considering holding it longer?"

You can even toggle sound alerts to get notified instantly no need to stare at charts all day.\r\n\r\nWhat stood out:\r\nNo friction just open your browser and go; no login or fees.\r\nMinimalist and practical, unlike bulky desktop apps or scripts.\r\nUses a simple delta and volume anomaly algorithm, with optional audio cues when, say, price change \u2265 3%.\r\n\r\nClickable tickers let you jump straight to Binance Futures charts.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon it yesterday evening and posted the link received a few comments and it stayed up through early morning, which I take as a good sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought this might be useful for anyone wanting to catch rapid moves\u2014pumps, dumps, volume surges\u2014without loading down their system\r\n\r\nQuestion for the group:\r\nDo tools like this actually help filter out noise and improve reaction time?\r\n\r\nWhat features would you find valuable like more customization, mobile alerts, token filters, or clearer visual cues?\r\n\r\nHas anyone used similar pump/dump scanners\u2014how did they compare?.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "This sounds like a scam. Why would you want to use crypto to pay if you\u2019ve never really used crypto?\n\nGenerally people looking for anonymous payment situations are trying to avoid capital gains taxes on their crypto profits.\n\nBut the idea of crypto as anonymous is a huge misunderstanding. Crypto is CENSORSHIP RESISTANT not anonymous. Governments can\u2019t control who or what you do with your magic internet money but they can certainly track it.\n\nIn fact blockchains are great for tracking payment flow that\u2019s one of their primary purposes. Everything is transparent and preserved for all time. For example, some people collect \u201cpizza sats\u201d which are the specific fractions of Bitcoin that were used in the infamous pizza purchase transaction in 2011."

The US isn\u2019t secretly erasing its debt with stablecoins, it\u2019s just obligating stabecoins to be backed by cash or treasuries (which they should be). For decades, countries have willingly bought US treasuries because they\u2019re safe and liquid, and that\u2019s not changing. Stablecoins just make the same system digital so people and businesses worldwide can use dollars more easily, and thereby hold treasuries indirectly. This doesn't magically wipe away $37T in debt, it just makes the dollar more accessible. Calling it a coup is really just rivals complaining about the dollar still being king."

Even if now it seems a *waste* to hold bags of stable or fiat through bearmarkets... In the hopes of growing our crypto stacks... But what if the next bear market we get... All tradfi currencies crash... And only the people holding \"bitcoin bags\" actually end up \"saved\" ? Wouldn't that be quite a scare? Would everyone then shift to bitcoin by no better choice? \nYea anyways... Why do we all thing that bitcoin and fiat can exist together ?

      "So rate cuts basically make money cheaper to borrow and less rewarding to save. When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, banks pay less interest on savings accounts and Treasury bonds become less attractive. This pushes investors to look for better returns elsewhere.\n\nI work at an engineering consultancy and we see this shit daily when our clients in fintech and crypto start adjusting their strategies around Fed decisions. Here's the simple version:\n\nLower rates mean people can borrow money cheaply. Investors who were parking cash in safe 5% Treasury bonds suddenly see those drop to 3% or whatever. Now they're looking at riskier assets like stocks, real estate, or yeah, Bitcoin to get better returns. More money flowing into Bitcoin = price goes up from demand.\n\nThere's also the inflation angle. Rate cuts usually happen when the Fed wants to stimulate the economy, which can lead to more dollars circulating in the system. More dollars chasing the same amount of Bitcoin means each Bitcoin is worth more dollars. Some people view BTC as a hedge against currency debasement, similar to gold.\n\nThe macro stuff gets messy though. Our customers building trading platforms have learned that Bitcoin doesn't always follow the textbook playbook. Sometimes rate cuts signal economic weakness and everything dumps together. Sometimes crypto does its own thing completely disconnected from traditional markets. The correlation isn't perfect.\n\nWhat actually matters for crypto markets is liquidity. Cheap money means venture capital flows, retail investors have extra cash to speculate with, and institutions can leverage up positions. When rates are high, that money dries up and people stick to safer assets. The difference between teams who engineer from first principles around market mechanics and those who just follow Twitter narratives is night and day.\n\nBottom line is lower rates generally create an environment where risk assets like Bitcoin thrive because the opportunity cost of holding cash decreases and there's more capital sloshing around looking for yield. But it's never guaranteed and plenty of other factors matter like regulatory news, adoption metrics, and whatever Elon tweets that week."

Backed by a viral persona (Professor Moriarty) and built on Solana, it offers fast transactions and low fees.  \nIts tokenomics (max supply 1B, \\~800-900M in circulation) plus gamified community incentives (XP, tasks, referrals) show that $MORI aims to be more than hype. With current market cap around\u00a0**$35-40 million**\u00a0and price levels around\u00a0**$0.045-0.05**, the upside is real\u2014but strong community action is key.

Years of chop, fakeouts, and false starts - hodling through every bump in the road. But here we are: altcoin market cap just locked in a Golden Cross.\n\nLast time we saw this was 2021, and what followed was a 140% rally in just a couple months. That was the kind of run where everything went vertical, and anyone who was positioned walked away with life-changing gains.\n\nNow layer in the backdrop: the U.S. government literally just shut down at midnight. Markets hate uncertainty, and fiat is showing cracks again. People are already calling Bitcoin and ETH the safest hedge against the mess. When capital floods into majors first, it doesn't take long before it spills into alts.\n\nAnd look at Solana right now - TVL blasting past $12B, protocols like Jupiter and Raydium pumping fees, BONK grabbing headlines again. It looks like real adoption this time, not just hopium.\n\nPersonally I'm not selling a single sat or ETH. My core is locked. But I've been borrowing stables against it on N\u0435\u0445\u043e to rotate into SOL plays without touching the base. It's the only way I feel comfortable playing offense while still keeping my foundation safe.\n\nThe wait has been brutal, no doubt. But Golden Crosses don't show up in dead markets - they're signals of momentum. And with the timing lining up with macro chaos and a fresh narrative, this feels like the spark we've been waiting years for.\n\nBuckle up. This might be the beginning of the move everyone's been grinding toward since 2021.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They joined it not because they care, but because they have no life and being part of something new and trendy that people enjoy is cool, it makes people feel validated. But when the end is near, it's no longer cool of trendy to be part of something old and dying, so people jump the boat, which is exactly what happened, everyone claimed they no longer liked GOT and blamed season 8, in truth they were never loyal fans, they just enjoyed validation and that comes to an end when something finishes.

I know that I did not subscribe because not only did I not agree to any trials but I certainly did not provide authorization to deduct funds from my bank account. The only transaction I ever did with Coinbase and that bank account was to transfer the initial funds to them. It is outrageous that they are taking advantage of this and right now they are telling me that they're only willing to refund one month.  But in reality they have simply stolen the funds.  Not only do they deserve to have to pay back everyone they have cheated, but honestly it should not be just those people who have the persistence to get it back. It should be everyone in the group who has been cheated.  Therefore, please let me know if you were interested in joining a class action lawsuit which I would instigate. The great thing about this is that not only would we get our funds back but everyone in the class who qualifies Coinbase would be required to pay back.  You can contact me through Reddit and through the private messages I can collect names and phone numbers of those who have been cheated."

      "You think it matters who's in office? The folks truly  running the show were never on a ballot and consolidated power before you were even born. They get radicalized people to fight other radicalized people all across the world.  It's real easy to tell people to strike and protest when you're somewhere else. For your information, the USA is not a true democracy because of primaries and the electoral college. Theoretically we're supposed to be a constitutional republic, however the most fitting label is corprotocracy in which cartels of essentially oligarchs. If you are calling for action, please at least be informed on what you're rallying for or against. \n\nOn a side note: the markets have been overwhelmingly overvalued and were correcting one way or another. The value of the US dollar is roughly \u00b9/13th of what it was 75 years ago and the buying power is even weaker. Legally speaking there is no rule, regulation, law, or policy being broken so in a court of law there are no grounds for a criminal case to be opened. The venue in which there is a chance for the people's ruling to be heard would be the court of popular opinion which essentially punishes the accused by tarnishing their public image which can lead to a host of personal &/or professional issues.\n\nSo if you are telling people to skip work and sabotage their own economy, at least instruct them to draft a bill, a policy change, a new law, more regulation, etc so they can centralize a decentralized system. \n\nMy suggestion is to study more and  cultivate a better understanding of the nature of this market. For someone to win, another must lose. If one can't weather the loss, simply don't leverage or sell for less than the entry. \n\nLast note: this is a scratch compared to the bloodbath coming soon. See these manipulations for the blessings that they are, decent entry points or if you want to get real fancy, proof that the pressure release valve is still functioning for a bit longer"

The failure isn\u2019t the market itself\u00a0 it\u2019s the lack of fair enforcement.\n\n\nIf crypto is truly democratized, corruption gets exposed and punished faster than in any centralized system. That\u2019s the market doing its job."

Do not trade on memecoins, bluechip coins give you time to at least exit and trigger your stop loss if there is a market crash. Futures is the worst kind of gambling period.

Paired with three 2025 rate cuts and Trump\u2019s $2K stimulus buzz, liquidity\u2019s flooding back. BTC dominance dropped from 60% to 52%, alt market cap\u2019s at $1.05T, and king of alts ETH already broke its ATH, ready for stronger move.\n\nThe History: QT to QE pivot pattern:\n\n* In May 2013, Bernanke\u2019s taper talk (slowing QE3\u2019s $85B/month) shook BTC from $120 to $100, but by December, gradual tapering sent it to $1,150, 6 months to peak, no alts.\n* September 2019\u2019s QT end, 50bps rate cuts, and $300B liquidity shot sparked ETH (+200%) and LINK (+500%), doubling alt cap to $100B. March 2020\u2019s monster QE ($700B/month, zero rates, $7T balance sheet) drove BTC from $5K to $69K and alts (UNI, AAVE 100x, SOL +11,000%) to a November 2021 top, 20 months from pivots.\n\nNow and why the cycle top\u2019s likely 6-12 months out (April-September 2026)\n\n* The Fed\u2019s September 2025 25bps rate cut to 4-4.25% as unemployment hit 4.3% marked the first easing of the year, signaling a shift toward looser monetary policy. This liquidity bump, with bank reserves steady near $3.2T, ETH/BTC ratio up 100% since may 2025. Bitcoin dominance, hovering at 59% (down from 66% peaks), suggests alts are catching bids, with ETH leading on ETF inflows ($4.8B+ YTD).\u00a0\n* Could alts double to $2.3T? Possible, but history warns of traps. The 2019 QT pause and cuts took 20 months to drive alt cap from $100B to $500B, fueled by retail FOMO in a smaller market. Today\u2019s $3.8T crypto market and ETF liquidity could compress that to 6-12 months, pointing to an early Q2 2026 peak. But the May 2026 Fed chair transition looms as a macro wildcard. No guarantees, markets love to humble the overconfident.\n\nThere will be a lot of volatility in the market, stay safe out there, my play book remaining the same, DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk. ETH will lead altcoin season as always, breaking ATH first and topping last (compare to most of alts, not your only special specific xxx coin). Stay close to ETH risk metrics to monitor your alts.\u00a0\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I were to be a betting man I\u2019d bet most big banks and asset managers like Black Rock would\u2019ve said the opposite about tariffs too!\n\nThen you also go on to say \u201clefties not thinking dollar debasement is the cause of almost all inflation\u201d is categorically wrong. That is not what leftists believe at all.

If I were to give an answer they\u2019d be in precious metals to hedge against the chaos your Trump has caused. Comparing crypto with heavy metals shows your cluelessness though since crypto is following stock markets and tech stocks a lot closer than anything else these days. \n\nThe labour market is fucked no matter how you put it. Would it have been bad if democrats won? Sure, it\u2019s bad worldwide for western countries right now. It sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have been this bad though. Unemployment isn\u2019t being skewed by \u201cimmigrants leaving\u201d first off what a way to put it bravo just sweep any kind of more accurate way to describe it under the rug, second off unemployment isn\u2019t getting massive among newer jobs due to the chaos and uncertainty Trump has caused the global and American economy that there\u2019s no jobs for people finishing college.\n\nI think it\u2019s actually time you take your head out your ass and smell the reality to the chaos your vote contributed the country, the world, and these crypto markets.\n\nThen you finish your comment saying to stop investing in shit coins as if the whole market isn\u2019t falling. Please tell me again which party leader and president launched a shitcoin, had his wife launch a shitcoin, and had his fan base fall for both scams twice?

Honestly, most people underestimate how much emotional capital this stuff drains.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already lost more than you\u2019re comfortable with, the best move is to pause trading and protect your mental balance first. Historically, crypto does recover  but it rarely does it smoothly. It grinds sideways when everyone\u2019s scared, then suddenly rips up when nobody\u2019s ready. That means timing it perfectly is nearly impossible.\n\nIf you still believe in the long-term story, dollar-cost averaging small amounts instead of going all in at once usually works better. That way, if it dips more, you get a better average price, and if it bounces, you\u2019re already in. Try not to let short-term noise make long-term decisions for you that\u2019s how most people miss the recovery."

What can you expect of the market where American president comes to rug you?

In recent years, China has also freed itself from part of its dollar credits and bought gold (both out of fear of an American debt crisis and to make itself more independent).\n\nBitcoin is not yet tested to cover such a situation and there are conflicting opinions. However, keep in mind that in addition to long-term dynamics, there are short-term ones, and in these speculative assets can easily rise.\n\nI would say that the current situation is: \"Hey, dear important banking client, since the situation is becoming delicate, let's continue doing what we were doing before, but in the meantime let's also put some gold in the portfolio, just in case.\""

There are videos out there with crypto giants stating clearly that there was a huge debanking campaign, similar to obamas efforts with gun manufacturers/dealers. Ive heard other dipshit dems say the same crap about gensler protecting the fed being \"enforcement\" and \"oversight\". Once the adults took over, 95% of genslers law suits were dropped, so you may be right to the tune of 5%, but the rest of the efforts were flat out war against crypto. It's your life and your money.

      "As for books in the general sense, I liked:\n\n - The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth\n\n - Broken Money by Lyn Alden \n\n - Paper Money Collapse by Detlev Schlichter a bit less, mainly due to its lack of clarity and convoluted exposition\n\n - there's also this one, an excellent analysis of the geopolitical use of crypto and the history of how they emerged, but it's only in Italian: La geopolitica delle criptovalute by Elham Makdoum the author is a former high-ranking analyst at the Italian Ministry of Defence. In the third party preface, there is a mentions of another similar \"masterpiece\" text \"the second in the world\", but the title isn't given and I haven't found it.\n\nAs for general objectives, even in hindsight, https://thenetworkstate.com/book/tns.pdf isn't bad, although it describes something that seems improbable today.\n\nUnfortunately, I have very little to recommend in terms of specific, technical texts if you don't have an IT background. There are the whitepapers of various cryptocurrencies, describing their objectives and operating techniques. There are a few texts on DeFi, but they are very introductory; I don't have a particular one to recommend. You can choose by searching \"introduction to DeFi\" from Annas Archive to Amazon; the former is also useful for seeing the most interesting ones, as it's unlikely that anything uninteresting (at least to someone) would be published there.\n\nHijacking Bitcoin by Roger Ver is a good read or even just https://blog.dshr.org/2025/09/the-gaslit-asset-class.html and a short, historical book The Science Of Government, Founded On Natural Law by Clinton Roosevelt https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/sciencegovernme00roosgoog/sciencegovernme00roosgoog.pdf also available in print for little money is PRETTY useful to understand today society (it start strangely but you will understand quickly) essentially is the crude, simple and clear description of current economy from a 1841 dream of a NY bank silver scam scammers.\n\nWith these, you'll understand why cryptocurrencies were created, their role, and therefore where they might or might not go in the near future, their flaws which are generally not mentioned, and a general overview of the real economy most fails to understand.\n\nFrom these, based on your expertise in economics, currency, and IT, you can figure out how to navigate with a solid foundation."

      "I do spot trading. Majority of the time these coins go up and down in a sideways motion. From these fluctuations you can make realized profit or grid profit. That is you have tools that most exchanges have in the form of algorithms that do spot trading on your behalf automatically, buying coins of your choosing on your behalf when the pricec dips to sell when the price goes up. Buy low, sell high IA the basics of spot. These bots have the discipline to keep making these tiny small profits. 117 usdt into doge for example you can probably earn 4 usdt a month if you want to grow you capital depending on how you setup the grid bot such as how many grids within a certain range. I set mine to be 0.185 to 0.3 with the reasoning that I am a conservative trader that can survive massive dips(like the one on Friday).  I still have much of my money in tact and the loss is unrealized meaning its temporary due to the bot buying the dip which will be good for me when the price eventually goes  up to meet those sell lines in the bots algorithm parameters. For you it would probably be the same. I would never advise you to do anything high risk such as futures with leverage. Avoid it like the plague if you hope to grow your capital."

He points out that previous crypto market cycles were largely tied to M2 money-supply expansions and the four-year halving schedule, but this time the trigger may be something crypto has never faced: a global economic contraction.\n\nWoo emphasizes that crypto markets aren\u2019t immune to broader financial system trends. When GDP falls, unemployment rises, spending drops and liquidity tightens, assets like crypto could experience bear-market behavior akin to tech stocks, rather than acting like safe-havens such as gold. While no recession is imminent yet, trade tensions and slowing growth are on his radar as potential catalysts.\n\nThis warning is worth keeping in mind: if we\u2019re heading into a cycle where the \u201cmacro engine\u201d drives the next leg down, that alters how we think about risk, timing, and even portfolio strategy for digital assets.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Luckily, I realized that was my own mistake and due to me being new in the crypto space - this type of up and down is common and expected. I should have waited but I FOMO bought in the Summer as crypto was steadily climbing, I was broke when it was time to buy the dip \ud83d\ude06, then tried to stack again at the wrong time in September fooled by all of the \u201cUptober\u201d Posts. Everyone\u2019s mad cause they can\u2019t time the market - we\u2019re not politicians or politicians sons, it just is what it is, quit whining and just buy & hold and be patient. If it\u2019s rigged so what - I just want a piece of the pie at this point. Or even just a seat at the table if I\u2019m being honest. I quit day trading for this reason - it\u2019s also not what it was, watching too many people get liquidated right now, I took out my futures acct money and put it all into XRP. Rather than sitting around crying and whining I realize OK things change - But Crypto is here to stay. Buy & hold or get out and invest in Gold or Silver or something. Personally I like crypto and I like my odds. Of course there\u2019s always a risk of losing everything. There\u2019s also a risk of a nuclear explosion. Or dying of a horrible disease. Or a car crash. Point being id rather take the chance spend 10k and lose it all in crypto than waste it in a 1 time vacation or new car. To me the investment now is worth the potential later.

Someone else can correct me where I'm wrong. \n\nSomething like 5% of wallets own 90% of all Bitcoin in existence.\n\nMore than half of all ethereum in existence is owned by 10 addresses, though their move to proof of stake provides some stability. More than BTC IMO. \n\nThere are billions of unreleased XRP in escrow that are released on a schedule, though Ripple does remove many from circulation to maintain manipulation of the the price.\n\nAll it would really take is 1 of these few wallets to sell out and completely tank a currency.\n\nThere is still money to be made in crypto., but the days of turning not much into millions are all but over, outside of mere chance and a lucky guess along with great timing. \n\nThen there is always the possibility of regulation and worldwide mass adoption of some or multiple currencies then the sky is literally the limit, but there are millions of people all guessing as to which it could be, and the shitty thing is if there is one it may not even exist yet. \n\nStay away from shitty meme coins though, seriously.

I have funding for the firm but I'm trying to learn how to develop (eventually at launch I'll hire or work with a vendor for this, but want to learn basics so I don't get backdoored and know what's going on).  \n\nI have to say, it's certainly not been easy to find help.  AI is a godsend but there are still funky things where I have a hard time figuring out.  It's 100% more my fault than the ADA community but what I'm saying is that there doesn't seem to be very simple tools for generating tokens/NFTs.\n\nI'm trying to run a Node as a starting point and I get a failure because my PowerShell terminal tells me that the Node-Socket cannot be created.  AI says that Windows doesn't support Sockets natively like Unix does, so I'm still trying to figure that out.  If anyone can help that would be super appreciated!"

      "Mixed emotions here too \u2014 and some concrete ideas.\n\nI participated in reviews and had two proposals with ~50 reviews each. The tone was broadly positive...yet the vote totals didn\u2019t reflect that signal at all. That gap tells me we have issues with discoverability, review quality, and incentives, not just outcomes. If the only way to get a proposal funded is to have successful social media reach, only previously successful proposals can ever get funded.\n\nWhat I observed:\n\n- It often felt (on Discord) like only proposers were talking to proposers. Great review threads existed, but very few voters seemed to see them.\n- Many reviews were \u201call 5s\u201d with book-report rephrasing of the proposal, not actual reasoning.\n- Things were flagged as AI that weren\u2019t, and obvious AI slipped through. I\u2019m pro-AI as an assist (clarity, structure), not as copy-paste filler.\n\nPractical suggestions for next time:\n\n- There should be some fake proposals seeded in the mix, so they can be compared to how reviewers review them (i.e. a clearly bad one that gets all 5s means the reviewer is not doing their job).\n- Require a short \u201cHow AI was used (if at all)\u201d note in proposals. Allow assistive use; penalize unedited dump. Combine automated detection with human spot-audits.\n- There needs to be much better discovery for voters. This was the biggest flaw in this process.\n- Reward reading, not volume. Fewer reviews per proposal, higher quality: micro-bounties for reviewers whose reasoning aligns with auditor consensus; cap per-reviewer volume to avoid rubber-stamping.\n\nI\u2019m sticking with Catalyst because I believe in the goal: fund real work that moves Cardano forward in the world outside our bubble. If folks are organizing a working group on reviewer calibration, AI-use guidance, or ballot UX, I\u2019m in and happy to help draft suggestions and test changes."

So no you don\u2019t build apps or dApps on the CCIP because it is not a blockchain or ledger or execution layer, it has no blockspace or smart contract hosting of it\u2019s own, what you do with CCIP is plug into it, and what it means to plug into CCIP is it is a middleware protocol that lets contracts on existing chains talk to each other, CCIP provides messaging and token transfer APIs between chains.
