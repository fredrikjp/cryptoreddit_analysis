I've been creating industrial automation for 15 plus years, labor is not as valuable as you may think. Engineering and automation can greatly reduce or even eliminate labor in most cases. The skilled labor that goes into it is not as intensive and not fulfilling to all people's purpose, so we must think bigger. \nSome of us will labor even though we don't need to cause we want to but not laboring and being consistent and dedicated can be just as prosperous in life and with that we should rejoice. The shackles are removed and we are truly free. Have zero fear and go out and live your best life cause that's all that matters. Do what you love, cause nothing else matters."

Not selling any mined BTC.  \nFree to do as they see fit.    \n.   \n\nMiners that I invest in are completely ready to pivot :     \n1. AI Computer & 2. Sell massive power hookups to AI Data Centers.     \nIt\u2019s literally in their investor docs - build large power infrastructure; ride out BTC mining while it\u2019s attractive.  Then sell to AI Data.    \n\nWe\u2019ve all recently seen how companies pivot - even when times *should* be okay for mining.  But they know where this is headed.  \nBTBT, BMNR, BTCT, & others all dropping BTC mining - now, when it\u2019s opportune.   Others will be forced to drop it in next bear market; and especially after the 2028 Halving.    \n\nOver time \u2026 next decade or so \u2026 you cannot escape the fact that Miner Revenue decays exponentially."

      "Oh trust me, I know, I despise the guy. I'm simply saying, if he keeps bullshitting about fake numbers he's actually hurting his own chances of a rate cut, which he's been begging for all year. I don't think he even realizes how dumb his position is right now.\n\nIf you want to pretend the job market is strong and everything is perfect, why cut rates as you demand? So stupid lol."

      "Bro, bonk guy is extremely legit ... *extreeeeemely legit*. I call him Uni, sometimes because i noticed many of his friends on CT did. He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"
