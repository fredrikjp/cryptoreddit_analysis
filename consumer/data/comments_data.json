I've been creating industrial automation for 15 plus years, labor is not as valuable as you may think. Engineering and automation can greatly reduce or even eliminate labor in most cases. The skilled labor that goes into it is not as intensive and not fulfilling to all people's purpose, so we must think bigger. \nSome of us will labor even though we don't need to cause we want to but not laboring and being consistent and dedicated can be just as prosperous in life and with that we should rejoice. The shackles are removed and we are truly free. Have zero fear and go out and live your best life cause that's all that matters. Do what you love, cause nothing else matters."

      "Quite similar. Even more similar to leveraging your stock value. The key is that bitcoin is a finite monetary asset with all the properties of a hard money like gold, but better/faster/stronger. Because the dollar will continue to be printed over time, bitcoin will naturally appreciate against the dollar\u2019s debasement. \n\nThis means your loan\u2019s liability reduces as Bitcoin appreciates. Check out this example to see how powerful this concept is:\n\u2014\u2014-\nIf you take a $30,000 Bitcoin collateral loan with $100,000 in Bitcoin as collateral (at a Bitcoin price of $100,000), resulting in a 30% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, what would the new LTV be for each 1x multiple increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price from the initial loan position?\n\nStarting LTV: 30% ($30,000 loan / $100,000 Bitcoin value).\n\nFor each 1x multiple in Bitcoin price (e.g., $100,000 to $200,000):\n\t\u2022\tLoan remains $30,000.\n\t\u2022\tNew LTV = $30,000 / (new Bitcoin value).\n\nCalculations:\n\t\u2022\t1x (BTC collateral value $200,000): $30,000 / $200,000 = 15%.\n\t\u2022\t2x (BTC collateral value $300,000): $30,000 / $300,000 = 10%.\n\t\u2022\t3x (BTC collateral value $400,000): $30,000 / $400,000 = 7.5%.\n\t\u2022\t4x (BTC collateral value $500,000): $30,000 / $500,000 = 6%.\n\nEach 1x multiple greatly improves your loan\u2019s health as the LTV reduces from the appreciation, as the loan\u2019s dollar value stays fixed while collateral value increases.\n\nLike Michael Saylor says in the clip, this allows you to open a new loan and get out more funds to bring the loan to value back to where you like to keep it, 30% or 20%, whatever is comfortable for you."

      "WARNING ABOUT SCAMS:  Recently there have been a lot of convincing-looking scams posted on crypto-related reddits including fake NFTs, fake credit cards, fake exchanges, fake mixing services, fake airdrops, fake MEV bots, fake ENS sites and scam sites claiming to help you revoke approvals to prevent fake hacks. These are typically upvoted by bots and seen before moderators can remove them. Do not click on these links and always be wary of anything that tries to rush you into sending money or approving contracts.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "Bro, bonk guy is extremely legit ... *extreeeeemely legit*. I call him Uni, sometimes because i noticed many of his friends on CT did. He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"

      "tldr; A crypto trader, Techdev, argued that the idea of becoming a billionaire by holding Bitcoin since its early days is unrealistic due to its extreme volatility and brutal corrections over the years. Techdev highlighted the difficulty of maintaining 'diamond hands,' or strong risk tolerance, through Bitcoin's ups and downs. Many in the crypto industry agreed, noting that most early investors either sold too soon, lost access to wallets, or spent their Bitcoin. Holding long-term requires exceptional discipline and conviction.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

Traditionally, Bitcoin's price would peak post-halving, followed by a significant crash, but recent trends show deviations. Analysts suggest the cycle's predictability is diminishing, with reduced volatility and institutional investments stabilizing the market. Experts believe the era of 70-80% crashes may be over, replaced by milder corrections of 30-50%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

Do you know why Gold was the best money for thousands of years ? we are used to the government papers nowadays, but not long ago we used metals as money. And gold was the most valuable of all, yet you can eat it, drink it, it just sits there. And I will use you own words:\n\n\"Sure Gold has more liquidity name/brand recognition, but it's not for what it does. It does nothing. It's just people believe. That's all. It's air.\""

If you're interested in reading the full story, head [here](https://cardano.org/governance/).\n\nOtherwise just go into your Yoroi wallet and click on the Governance tab on the left. Since Voltaire we have decentralized governance on Cardano, and you are required to make a choice in order to withdraw rewards. This is mandatory.\n\n* You can choose to Abstain, meaning you won't partake in governance.\n* You can choose a DRep, someone who will represent you in upcoming governance decisions - this will require you to look into some of the DRep options to make an informed decision.\n* You can choose to become your own DRep. This option is not really recommended, since you pay a pretty hefty sum for that, and you would be expected to get involved in the voting process.\n\n?governance"
