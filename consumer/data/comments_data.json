I've been creating industrial automation for 15 plus years, labor is not as valuable as you may think. Engineering and automation can greatly reduce or even eliminate labor in most cases. The skilled labor that goes into it is not as intensive and not fulfilling to all people's purpose, so we must think bigger. \nSome of us will labor even though we don't need to cause we want to but not laboring and being consistent and dedicated can be just as prosperous in life and with that we should rejoice. The shackles are removed and we are truly free. Have zero fear and go out and live your best life cause that's all that matters. Do what you love, cause nothing else matters."

      "You stupid fuckhead who FUD off this shit. You're either too ignorant about the entire ripple/XRP process or you are just working for ulterior motives which surely are for your own benefit. \n\nEVERY FUCKING MONTH Ripple does this. It's written into their protocol and they must. \n\nThis is taking coins out of circulation and it is not selling of any type. \n\nThe number of ass wipes that want to shit on crypto to pump their own interests is disgusting. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you're a ripple fan or not, at least know what the hell you're talking about when you give people you're fucked up investment advice that you just blew out of your ass."
