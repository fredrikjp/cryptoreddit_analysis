I\u2019m very interested in investing in cryptocurrency. My plan is to invest $25 every week for the next 3\u20134 years consistently. However, my knowledge about crypto is almost zero.\n\nI don\u2019t have a proper mentor or a clear guideline. I have tried to learn from different places, especially YouTube, but I haven\u2019t found anything that truly helps me understand things well.\n\nSo, I\u2019m reaching out to those of you who have been involved in crypto for many years and are investing regularly. I would like to learn from your experience about everything an investor should know\u2014what steps to take, what skills are important, and how to start from zero.\n\nI hope you can guide me in the right direction.

      "I've had a few. Just keep in mind that they work for you rather than the other way around. They are there to give you advice but you are still in control over the decisions with your money. You can tell them how much you want allocated toward Bitcoin and how much you give them discretion toward other things.\n\nHowever, I would consider looking into getting a fiduciary. They are much less biased because they are supposed to do what is in your best interest instead of what is in their best interest. The two things are often not the same. Whole lot of financial advisors. Will try to convince you into some life insurance scam that really isn't in your best interest, but it pays them the most so they're going to tell you to do it or give you a narrative and try to make you believe that it's in your best interest. If fiduciary usually won't do that because they are paid a flat fee regardless of what you do and won't make more money by trying to convince you to do things that aren't in your best interest but will make them more money. Truth is you can't really trust a lot of financial advisors. They'll see your Bitcoin and think, man if I could just get him to put that into something I make a percentage on, I could be making a ton more money. And so they will continually hound you to put that total balance towards something else that isn't in your best interest. A Fiduciary might also try to convince you to put your Bitcoin towards something else, thinking that it's too volatile and may not be in your best interest to have so much money and a volatile asset, but at least their suggestion comes from a place of honesty and concern over what's in your best interest. You can still disagree with them and tell them you want to keep a larger share in Bitcoin or whatever for a long-term. Just explain to them you're long-term vision and say hey. I know it's volatile. I know there's going to be times where it dips really hard in a bear market, but I believe that over the long term it's going to go up a lot more dramatically than most other things, so I accept that. It's riskier and I won't blame you for anything that happens with the Bitcoin. And they'll feel fine about it as long as they have shared with you their concerns and that you understand the risks. And they'll even often support you in your decision that you make based on understanding and information. \n\nBut whether you have a normal financial advisor who's biased and self-interested or a fiduciary who's a lot less biased, you still get to choose to do whatever you want with your money. You can tell them you want to keep a certain amount there and they can play with a different amount. If you do have somebody who is not a fiduciary and makes extra money off of selling you to do things that aren't necessarily in your best interest but pays them more money, I would make them justify any of their decisions. Then tell them you'll think about it and look into it, go run it into an AI and ask the AI about everything they said and to potentially counter against it with different advice or explain whether or not they're likely suggesting it cuz they make more money off it or whether it's really in your best interest. I just wouldn't leave it all up to trusting them when they have a conflict of interest in what you do and what they suggest to you. The easy solution is to get a fiduciary who has no conflict of interest, or at least is less likely to have a bad conflict of interest."

The real interesting stuff begins when prices of these assets begin to be denominated in BTC rather than USD.\n\nMaking bold claims from such broadly measured categories is kind of meaningless though, business can own real-estate, and BTC so if you measure equities are you measuring that or the underlying real-estate? And then what about derivatives? Do you count them or not? Currency? BTC backed loans to purchase property?  At some point it gets pointless because they all are representations of the other types."

      "One of the biggest things I've been thinking about is how a truly deflationary currency could change the world. We're conditioned to think deflation means catastrophe, but if everyone used the same store of value with a fixed supply, the deflationary benefits of technology's increases in productivity would be spread equally to all of society. Everyone would constantly be getting richer in equal proportion to increases in productivity over time. \n\nSome postulate this would collapse the economy because all rational consumers would save in perpetuity, but I'm not so sure. If you had confidence that your savings would only grow in purchasing power over time while still being paid a salary, I think many people would be incentivized to spend. Another interesting benefit is that it would be the default for wages to outpace profits rather than underperform them because companies would explicitly have to decrease wages in line with deflation over time - which people would be much less willing to accept compared to the subtle malevolent decrease in purchasing power that comes with a stable salary that's not keeping pace with inflation. Even if we did accept salary decreases outright, I think the psychological effect would be such that people would inherently accept smaller decreases than they do now trailing inflation."

      "I don't think it's get rich, it's not get poor.  If you have your worth/value in fiat (dollars) - you look at them as ice cubes.  Now these ice cubes are starting to melt slowly (dollar is losing worth/value through inflation and over printing of money).  So what do you?  What lot of people are doing is simply selling their ice and using that to buy something else that doesn't melt and holds its value.  Let's say you sold all your ice and bought hay (you convert your dollar stash to BTC).  Now you have that asset that isn't melting away.  Yay!    Here's the kicker, that hay you bought, there's a shortage in hay and now that hay has gone up in value and you are making money.  Now everyone wants to jump in.\n\nThe primary purpose of Bitcoin right now is to convert your melting cash into a non-melting asset (aka BTC, Gold, real estate, etc...).   That is it.  Bitcoin is that lifeboat for lots of people who are holding cash and seeing its purchasing value melt away.   Now, everyone is doing this to a limited asset and so this is why the price is going up - because the demand is going up and there is a limited supply.  This is Economics 101.\n\nPeople will always want to jump on anything that is trending that is making money.  Why not!?  I have no problem with this.  The speculation part is applying Economic math equations to the current market.  Lots of demand, not a lot of BTC means price is going to go up.  That reality is that Bitcoin and Crypto are the only markets where someone can invest and make substantial gains.  You can't do that in the bond market, stock market, saving market - there just isn't anything available for the little man to participate in and make money."

I did also reach out to them when I first found my account but I never heard back so I'm not sure what's going on there.\n\nI will say that they do take their time responding to tickets. I went back and forth with them for like 2-3 weeks because their verification system just didnt work. If you get quick replies I would consider yourself lucky. Could also look into hiring a lawyer if they don't end up letting you withdraw it. If its a decent amount it would be worth it as Bitcoin is going to $1 million in the future."

You are protesting against organisations putting profit above our own health (ie rushing COVID-19 vaccines). You are protesting against those in power not being treated the same as plebs (ie Epstein files). You are protesting against your savings losing value year on year which is even more unbearable when you dont have much meaningful amounts of money to invest. You are protesting against rampart inflation that impacts the middle class and poor the most. You are protesting against self-serving mentality that is rampant throughout the world at the expense of the fellow man and woman. \n\nThe money is dirty. Some have access to cheat codes whereas others do not. \n\nI use a good analogy with friends. At the height of Counter Strike 1.6 it was amazing. Then people started to cheat and hack. Most of my friends, if not all of them, stopped playing, as it simply was not fair, and you just can't beat a team with hackers."

Some of my other investments are also long-term plays, but some are more short to medium term like 2-10 year time horizons. I skim off profits on average about every 3 years and then rotate those profits into Bitcoin for the long term. I have definitely held multiple stocks that I've been able to outpace Bitcoin in the short to medium term. The strategy has worked out well for me and if the goal is to ultimately stack as much Bitcoin as possible, I can do that more efficiently by investing in things besides just Bitcoin. \n\nSo as it stands my retirement is secured in a few different ways. I should be able to retire on my Bitcoin holdings alone. Then I should also be able to retire on my 403b investment alone. Lastly, I should be able to retire on my brokerage investments alone. If all three pan out then I'm more than set and not only am retiring but retiring early and decently wealthy.

But I don't recommend you to use a software wallet on your computer to store your bitcoin unless you have very good computer security habits.\n\nIf you do not have very good computer security habits, then I highly recommend you to use a hardware wallet to store your bitcoin instead of a software wallet. Some good hardware wallet options are the Coldcard Q, BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition, Blockstream Jade Plus, Trezor Safe 5 with Bitcoin-only firmware, Foundation Passport Core, and SeedSigner. These six hardware wallets are all good hardware wallets that have publicly available source code that can be reviewed.\n\nI personally don't mess with ETH based on principle and because I'm not interested in a cryptocurrency that is centralized or that had a premine, and ETH is both centralized and had a large premine, but I guess I would recommend you to use the normal Trezor Safe 5 or normal BitBox02 to store it.

However as far as a break in the four-year cycle for an incoming bear market at least one that would be comparable to previous bear markets draw downs in my opinion, is a slight mystery. I say that, because although the halving cycles have not changed, nor will they\u2026 Institutional adoption, ETF inflows, bitcoin treasury companies, states/nations/funds creating reserves, 401ks/pension access, and the beginning of financial instruments that are able to tap other markets/their market caps (bond market 500T alone etc.). Have changed not only the amount of exposure that people who previously did not have the opportunity to have to bitcoin, and other crypto assets for that matter. It has also changed the amount of M2 money supply that can flow into bitcoin that previously was impossible through new legislation, and more crypto friendly environment, and more recognizable adoption by those who previously didn\u2019t understand what it even was or how to acquire it. \n\nThis is not financial advice in anyway.. I\u2019m a degenerate bitcoin maxi, with a heavy biased, who owns bitcoin, and is also irresponsibly long MSTR! The only thing I can say is you can\u2019t go wrong stacking stats, and not worrying about the short term, if you truly believe, and are in this for the long game."

      "To take a stab at a simple explanation: Bitcoin is a distributed ledger. Thousands of nodes around the world are keeping track of the ledger, that is to say the list of who owns how many bitcoin. When miners solve their \"puzzle\" they earn the right to post a new block of transactions and collect the fees attached to them. Every node then checks their work, makes sure it all follows the agreed upon rules, and then updates their copy of the ledger. No single entity is in control because there's no one master copy of the ledger, just a system for the nodes to agree upon the correct state of it.\n\n\nWhat you store as an owner of bitcoin is not the bitcoin itself, but a private key. Private key / public key cryptography is a system where you basically have two magic codes. One of them can encode a message that the other can decode. You make one of them publicly known and keep one of them secret. Then when you encode a message with the secret one, people can decode it with the public one to confirm that the message really came from you. This is how you prove ownership of and move your bitcoin, because there is a public key attached to the bitcoin on the ledger and you can mathematically prove you know the corresponding private key. Nobody can guess your private key because it's a 256 bit number, bigger than the number of atoms in the universe. You could guess a million times a second for a million years and get nowhere.\n\n\nCentralized exchanges are institutions that have order books and basically exist as middlemen to connect buyers and sellers and skim a fee / spread for their trouble. Trading does happen peer to peer as well."

Maybe some of the early contracts I created will be worth much more in the future.\n\nLike most people, I kicked myself, got back in at much higher prices, held through multiple crypto winters, and still end up negative on crypto investments (dmg from several shitcoins & associated pump and dumps). Eh, as long as you don't play with money you can't afford to lose, you're fine.\n\nSo yeah, even for people who's been involved in crypto for a while, profit is not guaranteed. Just like stocks, you have to have conviction and diamond hands. Most people aren't built for it."

They instead borrow to leverage, to do other investments, or maybe occasionally for some one off splurge, which then then recover/amortize over a period.  But NOT for living expenses on and on forever.  E.g., many rich people have mortgages on property, because they have uses for the money that yield more than the interest cost.  Or because the property then generates income higher than the interest cost.  Same with margin on stocks.  This is just leveraged investing."

      "Deflation doesn\u2019t reduce economic activity to subsistence, it removes waste. People will still spend on food, housing, healthcare, and the things they truly value. The difference is they won\u2019t be incentivized to take on reckless debt just to keep up with inflation. Innovation doesn\u2019t die under deflation, it thrives, because companies must compete on real value. Look at tech\u2026laptops, TVs, and phones have gotten cheaper and better year after year. That\u2019s natural deflation, and it expanded the market, not collapsed it.\n\nAs for authoritarianism, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to suppress alternatives. Anyone can create or use weaker currencies if they want. The difference is that nobody will voluntarily hold money that bleeds value once they have access to the hardest money ever invented. This is exactly why fiat replaced gold in practice: not because gold wasn\u2019t valuable, but because gold was inefficient to spend and settle with. It was heavy, clunky, and not easily divisible, so people accepted fiat for convenience, especially once governments forced the transition in 1933.\n\nBitcoin fixes those inefficiencies and adds every property that makes it the apex form of money. It is absolutely scarce with a hard cap of 21 million. It is infinitely divisible down to sats, which means it works for both global trade and microtransactions. It is weightless and portable, able to move anywhere in the world instantly. It is durable and indestructible so long as the network exists. It is verifiable and transparent, where every unit can be validated by anyone. It is censorship resistant, meaning no government or bank can block or seize it without your keys. It is borderless, operating the same everywhere on earth. It is decentralized, so there\u2019s no single point of failure or control. It is programmable, opening the door to innovation and new applications. And it is backed by real world energy expenditure through proof of work, anchoring it in physical reality.\n\nGold had scarcity but failed on efficiency. Fiat had efficiency but failed on trust and scarcity. Bitcoin unifies both and upgrades them, giving us money that is simultaneously scarce, secure, portable, divisible, durable, verifiable, censorship resistant, borderless, decentralized, programmable, and energy backed. That\u2019s definitely doesn\u2019t sound like authoritarianism to me, and sounds more like free market choice driving convergence toward the best form of money humanity has ever had."

That's the reason why so many get \"wrecked\" every single cycle, they typically buy in at the top thinking they will make crazy gain on some alt that heard about online. \n\nBTC specifically is well past the days where trading in and out of it is worth your time, even if you know what you are doing. This cycle we could peak at 150-180k and after a bear market bottom out around 60-80k. When you factor in things like capital gain tax this really isn't worth considering. In the 2021 and 2017 cycle I think there was definitely some merit to this though. \n\nBTC is an asset that is becoming increasingly more and more scarce. New supply to the market is rapidly decreasing and people are locking it away and holding it, as they see it as a long term asset now. Roughly .2 BTC is very solid and could do quite well in the 2030s and beyond. \n\nDo you already own this or planning on making this purchase? Regardless, buy and hold and seriously consider regularly stacking, imagine treating it like a savings account of sorts."

      "There is a lot of misleading and incomplete information on this thread. There are 2 distinct ways to support bitcoin.\n\n1. Mining Bitcoin - This is where you setup a computer to help solve the mathematical equations that create new bitcoin. The equations have become so complex that they require a very expensive computer to make it worthwhile for the average person. (Like enormously expensive computers!) This is not what this thread is discussing.\n2. Running a Bitcoin Node - This is what we are discussing on this thread. When Bitcoin is bought and sold each transaction must be verified by at least 6 computers running the Bitcoin Node software on the network. If it has not been verified by 6 computers the transaction is not considered legitimate and is not added to the ledger. There are currently tens of thousands of computers worldwide that are running the node software on the network 24 hours a day 7 days a week. A computer that is on the Bitcoin Node network can interact with as many as another 100 to 200 computers on the network at a time. This is what keeps Bitcoin decentralized and safe. If something happened to the network, all it would take is 1 computer that still contains the Bitcoin Ledger to restart the network. This is what we are talking about on this thread. How you can setup and run one of these Bitcoin Node computers. And no, you do this to keep the network safe as there is no monetary compensation for doing this. You can however set up your very own wallet on your node. This means that you store your bitcoin on your computer so that you don't have to use a service like Ledger, Trezor, Coinbase or Kraken to store it."

After he died, I needed to compile our finances, and I remembered I had an old retirement account. \n\nI found the original paperwork from the account, logged in, and found it had grown a whopping $1000 in 13 years - less than 2% a year. \n\nWhen I went to rollover the policy, I found I'd written notes from the salesman on the back of his brochures, and unlocked a totally forgotten memory!\n\nWay back in September 2011, this sketchy young libertarian salesman came to my work, selling various annuities, life insurance, 403b, etc. He explained his company's shitty products (which I bought), but then explained this outside 'opportunity,' that I could purchase separately through him. Per my notes, 'bincoy' would give me 'bmw money.' I decided to put $150/month into the 403b and $100/month into 'bincoy.'\n\nWent home and told my husband about it, who laughed at me and called me a sucker to fall for such an obvious scam. Called the guy back and asked for my $100 check back and to put it all into the 403b instead."

      "I would get some sort of exposure into BTC instead of completely sitting on the sidelines, but I wouldn't go all in or make some massive purchase either. For instance, you could buy .5 BTC, which would be less than 20% of your $ stack from your inheritance. This is a very sizeable position that few will reach but you also still have roughly $250,000 remaining. You could park this remaining money into a high yield savings account and the monthly interest could be invested into BTC. Meanwhile, you can continue to learn more about BTC before making even more major moves. \n\nIf you wanted to be a bit more aggressive though, here is my take.\n\nYou honestly could even just go in and become a whole coiner and just officially join that club and be done with it. VERY few people will ever attain this and by locking in this position you are going to be in fantastic shape. The people that talk about potential bear markets have a good point but it's not really something I'd concern myself with at this point. Realistically, if we are still going to follow a 4 year cycle we see a bear market low of 70-80k, maybe we get into the 60k range. Sure, that's quite a bit lower from here, but it's not like we are going from 60k to sub 20k or 20k to below 5k. There is way more long term potential to the upside than some down side risk of maybe 50% at the most from here, which may not even happen btw. You would still have close to 200k remaining in $ with this purchase AND have officially joined that club.\n\nThe caution I would have would be to make sure to learn about self custody, cold wallets and how to secure these funds so you don't lose them. Don't leave these funds on an exchange or just throw them on a wallet without thinking of how to secure the seed phrases."

If any of this is confusing then you have work to do to better understand how open source software works. It also explains my claim of why Satoshi coming back would have no effect on the software he created and then gave to the world. He's as free, or as limited, on what he could do with the code as the rest of us are.\n\nDecentralization. I think you may be conflating the Bitcoin protocol and network with pooled mining. Bitcoin is decentralized as a network because people from all over run the Bitcoin software, mentioned above, and they all connect to each other and enforce the rules of the protocol. When I mentioned centralization I was pointing out one major threat to Bitcoin security and censorship resistance and that is mining pool centralization. The more hashrate in control of fewer people diminishes the security of the network by giving outsized control of what transactions are included on the blockchain. It could also give them the power to reorganize the chain, censor transactions, load the chain with spam, or simply block transactions altogether.\n\nThis is what I meant though in my initial response. People out here are \"number go up\" focused and don't try to actually understand what Bitcoin is and participate in it. Bitcoin is not invincible and we all need to get involved, for our own selfish reasons, to make it robust and vibrant. You don't have to be a software developer to participate in the network and help strengthen it. We all want the number to go up but it won't if systemic issues within the project are not dealt with.\n\nRead a book: Mastering Bitcoin\nListen to a podcast: What Bitcoin Did\nUse a website: Learn Me a Bitcoin"

So is free speech, and i think long term you can't suppress these things. \n\nYour both arguing that bitcoin is a threat to the system, but also that it's really bad. If the population can't get loans and they blame bitcoin, they will stop using it and it'll fail.  \n  \nAnother aspect we haven't talked about is how the interest rate is set by the FED. If you had to go out and get a loan at market rates, it would be a lot higher because your now competing with stocks and real estate and things that appreciate in value.  \n\nI guess in a socialist leaning country you could just subsidize house loans on a bitcoin standard. Would just be through taxes instead of monetary inflation.  \n\nI'm convinced that bitcoin and fiat can't coexist. At least not long term. \n\nMaybe you'll find some signal in answers you get here, if not I would not recommend to stay here and read posts. Go to twitter or listen to some podcasts. This isn't a subject I'm particularly interest in, so I can't really recommend anyone other than the two authors.  Saifedean Ammous and Lyn alden.   \n  \nSaifedean Ammous has a podcast, he might have a some episodes on this subject."

To blow past gold would be to put Bitcoin more in a category akin to \"ALL US EQUITIES\" or something that feels more like a Goliath.\n\nAt that point it would be very difficult for anyone to say that it cannot continue going up, because it would start getting compared to much bigger asset classes, like real estate. At that point people will really consider whether or not buying a second home and earning rental income is really worth missing out on Bitcoin, especially when wealth taxes start eating into the value of real estate given that it's the only thing governments can tax and that would solve the housing crisis. You might have a political party that literally campaigns on a platform of collapsing real estate prices, in opposition to the collateral base of the banks, in favour of families and communities. Something like that is happening in London today, with real estate valuations dropping 8% per year according to some estimates. \n\nIf real estate is intentionally targeted to rake in some more taxes and solve the housing crisis (and therefore avert demographic collapse) then Bitcoin is stabilising at $30T is easy to imagine. \n\nAnd any gains from there would be pure fiat debasement, which could take it to $300T over the subsequent 10 years."

Prenup, prenup, PRENUP!! \n\nNow for a story. \nThere once was this guy named Bob. He met a girl and fell in love, got married, and had two kids. Life was great. So Bob thought. IMO Bob was doing what every partner should do. Supporting his partner while she got her education and helping her become the best version of herself that she wanted to be. The whole time assuming his wife would/was doing the same for him. To make this short, Bob's wife got her education and within months of graduating got caught cheating because she thought she had become better than and had outgrown Bob. Bob lost more than half of everything. His castle, his queen, his kids, and a boatload of money. Bob never imagined this would ever happen. The last meeting with my lawyer. I mean Bob's last meeting with Bob's lawyer to pay his final bill. Bob's lawyer asked what Bob had learned going forward and Bob said prenup.... and the lawyer said Smart man. DON'T BE BOB!!!  Don't worry it ends with a happy ending. Bob found a new girl, discussed a prenup when they first met, and they were in love. She agreed she would sign it. It was fair and also protected her equally. Bob got his house back, has his kids living with him full-time, and travels regularly. Life is good again but this time Bob's protected and so is Bob's new partner. Prenups should be automatic, it doesn't mean you don't love each other. It just protects everyone involved and saves a ton of money in the end. Make it while you're in love and then if it ever does go sideways you know what it will all look like. Almost no need for a lawyer. If your partner refuses to sign. Huge red flag and move on to the next one."

A method to generate mnemonic phrase based on collected entropy and a wordlist. A mnemonic seed phrase generated by this method embeds a checksum that allows to verify that the mnemonic has been entered. \n\n 2. A completely separate method to generate a BIP32 HD wallet seed from the mnemonic seed phrase plus the seed passphrase.\n\n\nThe gereration of the BIP32 seed (thevactual seed) does not require or enforce any specific method of generaring the.mnemonic, but does recommend using the method given in the same document..This open-ended design is intentional to.allow for translated wordlists, custom word lists or even completely different methods of generating the mnemonic,.without.requiring.that the wallet must implement them all. You.could use a Klingon word list to generate the.mnemonic seed and a fully BIP39 compliant waller would let you enter, possibly with a warning that it does not recognize the mnemonic and can not verify it's checksum.\n\n\n\nRegarding the 24th word...the last word is both.entropy and checksum.\n\nENT amount of entropy used when generating the mnemonic\n\nCS checksum size \n\nMS number of words in the resulting mnemonic\n\n\nCS = ENT / 32\n\nMS = (ENT + CS) / 11\n\n|  ENT  | CS | ENT+CS |  MS  |\n+-------+----+--------+------+\n|  128  |  4 |   132  |  12  |\n|  160  |  5 |   165  |  15  |\n|  192  |  6 |   198  |  18  |\n|  224  |  7 |   231  |  21  |\n|  256  |  8 |   264  |  24  |"

I was about to receive some money via Bitcoin and just asked since my knowledge is a few years old from the \"bitcoin core software wallet\" time and chatGpt told that one should never store them online or in a software wallet, which made sense so I just ordered a trezor and it was pretty straightforward. Short version: buy a trezor (or similar hardware wallet), download trezor suite (or similar software for said hardware wallet), set it up when it arrives, pretty easy, make sure to remember and write down (not digitally!!!) your 20 words seed phrase and you're done. if your device stops working, you can buy a new trezor, enter the 20 seed phrases and it will be as a copy of your original wallet, basically. \n\nAnd never! lose! your! seed! phrase!!! \n\nBut honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of AI tools but letting yourself walk through  something like this works pretty well.

But the stock market is over-priced. Are you really calling for hard examples? Because I can show the evidence. There's also a factor people are not considering which is a more longterm issue: Boomers are retiring. And with retirement comes a pull on investments for living expenses. The expected PE ratios of the market should fall where There's less demand for those investments. And they're already bloated as is. The worst part? Boomers aren't going to be working anymore, which drives up the cost of everything. Again, longterm issue. But relevant to the point that dumping everything you have into something blindly might just be feeding the disaster machine. Longterm investments are still a core strategy.

As more people adopt and use BCH, the demand for a limited supply increases, which naturally drives up the price.\n\nFor BCH to be a truly effective currency, people need to feel confident holding it. A stable or increasing value encourages people to use it not just for transactions but also to save it for the future, further cementing its role as a viable alternative to traditional money."

      "Your kind of energy shoyld be put into something honest but unfortunately you chose this path\n\nThis is not be classed as \u201cinnocent comments.\u201d You Are Shilling.\u00a0 Enticing buyers through promotional posting. Here\u2019s why: \n\nWhat Stands Out \n\nRepetitive mentions of the same token ($WHITENET / $WHITE) across multiple, unrelated subreddits (r/AllCryptoBets, r/memecoins, r/solana, r/btc, r/CryptoPeople, etc.). This is a hallmark of a coordinated promotion effort. \n\nDirect investment enticements: \n\n\u201cBuy now before it goes public\u201d \n\n\u201cBest entries happen before the masses show up\u201d \n\n\u201cPotential upside is insane\u201d \n\n\u201cCheck it out at whiterock.fi\u201d (with repeated links to the same site) \n\nThose are calls to action encouraging purchase/investment. \n\nHype & FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) tactics: \n\n\u201cGenerational plays are made\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can already sense the momentum building\u201d \n\n\u201cInstitutional backing\u201d and \u201clong-term believers\u201d language \n\nThis is persuasive advertising language, not neutral discussion. \n\nLink dropping: Direct links to the project site (\u201cwhiterock.fi\u201d, \u201cnetwork.whiterock.fi/contribute?code=SHE\u201d) appear over and over. This moves it firmly into advertising/solicitation territory. \n\nHow Different Groups Should View This \n\nReddit Mods \n\nAlmost all of these posts violate subreddit rules on self-promotion, spam, and shilling. \n\nThey should see this as coordinated marketing, not genuine contribution. Likely to be mass-removed and the account banned. \n\nRegulators (SEC, FCA, ASIC, etc.) \n\nBecause these posts encourage investment and contain links to a contribution page, they could count as financial promotions. \n\nIf the poster is affiliated with the project (developer, team member, or paid promoter), regulators would expect full disclosure. \n\n\u201cNot financial advice\u201d disclaimers won\u2019t protect against liability if the intent is promotional. \n\nThe repeated emphasis on future profit (\u201cupside,\u201d \u201cearly believers,\u201d \u201cbuy before public launch\u201d) may be interpreted as investment solicitation \u2014 which in many jurisdictions requires licensing or approval. \n\nBottom Line \n\nThis is not innocent commenting.\nIt\u2019s a clear case of enticing buyers through promotional posting across multiple Reddit pages. \n\nIt looks like a shilling campaign designed to build hype and attract investment."

You might want to try dusting off your graduate level geomorphology and fluid dynamics books first.  Many factors affect the carry capacity of a river and can change significantly over its entire length.\n\n>Lower layers don't fully support the layers above them?\n\nNo, trying looking up a subduction zone as one example.  The earth is a complex fluid/semi fluid/solid construction that is ultimately held together by gravity.  Without gravity, the earth would rip apart, same as the solar system and universe. \n\n>\nLike most of the Maxi's we get around here you are fixated on the wrong thing about BCH.\n\nIm not fixated on any one particular part, I hold bch and xmr in addition to btc.   After all, money is almost a purely social construct,  btc, bch, and xmr are no different.  \n\nI also view btc as a commodity, and it's up to humans to learn to use it, not try and modify it every chance we get to achieve something few computer programmers even slightly understand in the first place (economics, money, sociology and apparently geology which wasnt on my list initally)\n\nI dont want money that is easily \"upgraded\"  by some computer programmers, I want something that is extremely difficult to change."

This has been the case in Bitcoin even since before BCH came about.\n\nHence, if there is no 10-block finalization, and the partitions are not very equal in hashpower, the situation with competing chains is quickly and simply resolved simply by determining the chain with most work done.\n\nSame on BTC as on BCH.\n\nObviously, in the case of a major network partition, node operators on BCH currently would need to potentially override their 10-block finalization in order to merge again with a more-work chain of which they lost track."

      "For a regular Solana user, the introduction of p-token could mean several practical benefits, depending on how it plays out. Here's a breakdown in simple terms:\n\n1. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: P-token is designed to cut compute usage by about 95% for the token program, which handles most transactions on Solana (like sending SOL or other tokens). This could lead to lower transaction fees and quicker processing times, making it cheaper and smoother to use apps, trade tokens, or move money on the network.\n2. Improved Experience: With less strain on the network, you might notice fewer delays or glitches, especially during busy times. Solana has had outages in the past, and this upgrade could help make it more reliable for everyday use, like buying NFTs or staking SOL.\n3. Potential Delays Before Benefits: Right now, the process is stuck on audits and validator approval (SIMD-266). This could take weeks or months, so you won\u2019t see these improvements immediately. \n4. No Direct Action Needed: As a user, you likely won\u2019t need to do anything special\u2014wallets and apps should update automatically once p-token is live. Just keep an eye on announcements from Solana or your wallet provider."

      "I guess you know rugcheck.xyz. This site gives a good overview of potential risks. \n\nThe biggest pain point probably is being able to keep tracking everything without spending loads of money when starting with a small budget.\n\nYou can start tracking new tokens for free when using multiple providers that offer free rpc nodes and just push everything into questdb, for example. You can also do a lot of checks that are done by rugcheck yourself with the data of those free nodes. You'll quickly get a blacklist for creators of rugged tokens and so on. That's not the problem. But keeping up with the prices for new tokens definitely is when using free APIs as the list of active tokens grows.\n\nLong story short, if you're not able to pay hundreds per month, you can still easily collect a lot of interesting data, but it's hard to keep track of the token prices after some time. This specifically makes backtesting not totally impossible but definitely hard and somehow limited. As the data collection grows, you're potentially able to extend the rules to mark tokens as rugged or not interesting early, but at least for me, it's a slow process."

An additional 66% increase is planned for late Q3 or Q4. This is a tradeoff in decentralization because it increases hardware requirements and ledger growth. The 66% increase will almost double hardware requirements and increase ledger growth by about 150% while the ledger is already over 400TB and growing 80-100TB/year.\n\nThis stress-test doesn't reflect real world usage or true capability and isn't a breakthrough in scaling.

The bot pings you in real-time when multiple whales ape the same token, so you can jump in before the move runs away.\n\nOn top of that, it's got: \u2022Instant on-chain execution (snipes entries before you blink) \u2022Copy-trading straight from whale wallets \u2022Auto TP/SL and limit orders so you don't babysit trades \u2022Portfolio + PNL tracking built into Telegram\n\nIt feels like a cheat code for trading and sniping tbh.

The only thing the user pays is ~0.025SOL for the token creation and then of course however much for the initial buy.

Relying on\u00a0getTransaction\u00a0after a\u00a0logsSubscribe\u00a0event is definitely going to burn through your RPC credits and will still have a slight lag.\n\nThe big third-party APIs (like Birdeye, etc.) are your best bet for a simple solution, but as you said, they can be expensive and often don't meet that sub-1.5s latency requirement for a large number of pairs.\n\nHonestly, what you're trying to build is a core component of what high-performance trading bots do under the hood. They need to have the absolute latest price data to execute trades effectively and protect against MEV.\n\nMy team and I actually use a Telegram-based bot, JitoX, for our execution. While it's a trading tool on the front-end, its entire backend is an engine built to solve this exact data problem. It maintains a high-speed connection to the Jito block engine, which gives it access to transaction data and state changes faster than a standard RPC connection. This allows it to calculate real-time prices and execute trades with minimal latency.\n\nInstead of spending a ton of time and money building out this complex data infrastructure yourself, you might find it more efficient to leverage a tool that has already perfected it.\n\nThe bot is\u00a0JitoXai\\_bot\u00a0if you want to check out how it performs. It's a good example of a system that has solved the low-latency price feed problem."

      "Hey, happy to.\n\nIt's less of an 'app' in the traditional sense and more of a specialized trading terminal. The core idea is to solve the biggest frustrations that cost traders money on Solana.\n\nInstead of juggling a web browser, a wallet pop-up for every approval, and a DEX interface, it consolidates everything into a single, clean command-based environment. This means you can execute trades much faster, which is critical for new launches or volatile markets.\n\nBut the real magic is under the hood. It's built directly on the Jito block engine, which is essentially a high-speed, MEV-protected lane for transactions. Think of it like a shield. It helps stop your trades from getting \"sniped\" by sandwich bots, which is the main reason a trader's PnL shows a profit but their wallet is mysteriously down. It ensures the price you get is way closer to the price you clicked.\n\nIt's really built for traders who are tired of the 'invisible' costs of slippage, failed transactions during high-volume launches, and the general clumsiness of trying to trade quickly on a mobile browser.\n\nI'd drop the details here, but the r/solana mods (rightfully) don't allow links or handles to external groups in the comments to prevent spam.\n\n**Feel free to shoot me a DM, and I'll send you the info.**"

      "> If you increase the gas limit 100x, then even if gas prices per unit are lower, total fees burned can still be very high because so much more data can be included.\n\nYes, in theory. But only if demand still meets the capacity.\n\nIf you have 1000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 100 tx, you get a fee market for these 100 tx and the highest paying 100 tx from the pool of 1000 make the cut. \n\nIf you have 8000 tx lined up and the network has a capacity of 10000 tx, **everyone** pays **nothing**. 8000 x 0 = 0. And that's bad design in my opinion, because it means the possible 5000 of the 8000 tx which are uneconomical pointless spam are included too. It also leads to any capacity always eventually filling up with spam. \n\n>I think it's more likely that we'll see novel uses once there is much higher capacity.\n\nYeah, I dunno, that's the \"overestimate growth based on faith and hopium\" part I mentioned. Sure you can hope for new use cases, but that's betting on black swans. The network shouldn't work like that, it should not keep lowering fees while scaling blindly, assuming future usecases popping up to save the day."

      "> truth\n\nIf you *actually* believe the things you said, maybe it's worth correcting you?\n\n> And Vitalik can fork the code at will\n\nThe truth is that *anyone* can fork the code at will. Anyone can make a copy of the client code, make a few changes, and compile and run the new code. That's easy. Trivial even.\n\nThe hard part is convincing everyone else on the network to run the new code. Unless everyone else runs the same code as you, then any transactions you make will not be seen by everyone else, and your transactions will be inconsequential and ignored. Basically, running forked code by yourself means that you have created a new network that nobody cares about and has no value.\n\nThe thing Vitalik is really good at is *convincing other people* to run new code. He does this with a combination of being *smart*, *trustworthy*, and *eloquent*. He has good ideas with pretty high consistency, and he also listens well to other developers and adopts their ideas (with attribution, of course), and he does an unusually good job of explaining those ideas in blog posts and whatnot in a fashion that Ethereum aficionados are able to understand and appreciate. And he is trustworty in that he has never proposed rule changes that would be self-serving, or motivated by anything other than the desire for Ethereum to succeed. If he did, then he would lose respect and people would stop running his code.\n\nThis happened once, actually. With the DAO fork, not everyone was convinced that undoing the hack was a good idea. Only about 85% supported reverting the hack, and 15% chose to stick to Ethereum Classic instead. The Ethereum developers (including Vitalik) can't force anyone to run new, forked code. They can only propose it. The users are the ones who ultimately choose what code Ethereum runs on."

LastPass won't do more (if you're still using LastPass...). Every other password managers mentioned released a fix and communicated with their users about it.\n\n>**\ud83d\udfe0 1Password**  \n**Vulnerable version:**\u00a0<8.11.7.2  \n**Partially fixed:** 8.11.7  \n**Improvement:** You can now choose to have 1Password ask before it autofills logins, credit cards, or other non-credential items in your browser.

It remains to figure out though over which field the precompile should be allowed, as it is still widely used within elliptic-curve-based SNARKs (thus 256-bit field), which are quantum-vulnerable. As ZKVMs tend to use post-quantum SNARKs, they use Poseidons over the most efficient PQ-friendly field, of which several 31-bit ones are equally popular: KoalaBear, BabyBear, and M31. One of them should dominate, and if ZKVM proofs are accessed from EVM, we can select that field for a precompile."

      "Thank you for the question Pintail, and great to see issuance as a top voted question :)\n\n> It is still true that under the current curve all rational ETH holders will eventually (be forced to) stake their ETH\n\nShort answer: IMO yes\n\nLong answer: The issuance curve is designed such that nominal yield from issuance alone is at least 2%/year, even when all 121M ETH is staked. Operational costs (compute & bandwidth, devops, inactivity & slashing risks, activation & exit inefficiencies) are typically small (measured in basis points) and will go down significantly with things like L1 EVM SNARKification and attester-proposer separation (APS). As such the dominant staking cost is arguably external opportunity cost, e.g. from defi.\n\nToday there's roughly [2.5M ETH earning 2%/year on Aave](https://app.aave.com/). Even at today's levels, 2%/year is insufficient to have a significant impact on staking. Going forward it may be reasonable to expect defi yields to compress, e.g. as institutional money won't be afraid to lend in size. A final note is that defi yields are somewhat correlated and indirectly boosted by staking yields which will naturally go down from the current 3%/year.\n\nTo summarise, yes, IMO it's reasonable to expect staking costs to stay under nominal staking yields, and therefore for the total amount of ETH staked to keep growing as ETH holders increasingly grow rational.\n\n> How are researchers currently thinking about the process for reaching consensus on a suitable long term issuance curve?\n\nIMO a good first step would be to educate on the negative externalities of most ETH being staked:\n\n * **erosion of pristine collateral**: Staking absorbs yield-seeking pristine ETH, leaving relatively little for defi. We're seeing a taste of that today: defi markets are dwarfed relative to staking markets (e.g. 2.5M ETH in Aave vs 35.7M ETH staked). Another dynamic is LSTs finding their way into defi. For example in Aave there's 1.2M wstETH (earning 0.05%/year) and 0.3M rsETH (earning <0.01%/year). These LSTs add risks (smart contract risk, operator risk, governance risk), fragment the market, as well as compete with ETH as a unit of account which may negatively affect ETH's monetary premium.\n * **overpayment for security**: The primary goal of issuance is to pay for economic security. Most people would argue 50% of all ETH is insufficient economic security. IMO issuance expended to get the staking rate beyond 50% is wasteful. This waste materialises as fundamental sell pressure through income taxes, as well as memetic sell pressure through unnecessary nominal dilution.\n\n> no longer a sense of urgency about this problem\n\nIssuance is Ethereum's equivalent of global warming. It slowly creeps over, year after year. I remain optimistic that as the negative externalities become increasingly acute, and as the community increasingly appreciates the difference between nominal real staking yields, urgency will increase.\n\nAs I wrote this answer I decided to purchase realyield.org. If anyone would like to build a high-quality educational website on the difference between nominal and real yields, and as well as the negative externalities of overstaking, please do get in touch :)\n\n> How long do we have to take action on this?\n\nThere is arguably a limited window of opportunity to take action because core features of Ethereum like issuance naturally tend towards ossification.

      "I see a difference between 7782, which is a proposal for a feature (shorter slots) but is not clearly opinionated on a solution to achieve it, vs 7732 which is a specific solution to ship. Likewise, we should ideally first have a strong view on what the network needs and then coordinate on how to ship it, i.e., decide the specific solution and accelerate its development. If feature proposals cannot hope to compete against solution proposals because they are more under-specified, we need a way to have stronger commitments behind features, so that research and engineering resources can be aligned and the right features can be accelerated, vs deciding based on \"Proof-of-Work\".\n\nAs for Glamsterdam, the network needs scale, and while [I personally don't think that every part of 7732 justifies its cost](https://x.com/barnabemonnot/status/1953773053785051279), 7732 answers the need for scale and so is a good update in my view. Meanwhile, prototyping and metrics collection efforts are ongoing for shorter slots, mostly in EF Protocol teams but also in discussion with core devs. I remain convinced that shorter slots is one of the highest-impact proposals we should accelerate today (see the pitch [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7782-the-case-for-2x-shorter-slot-times-in-glamsterdam/24616)).\n\nSo I think we're working towards a better pipelined decision process that separates the feature selection (ideally driven by community and product considerations) from the solution selection (ideally driven by research and core devs)."

      "I wouldn't call it a blocker necessarily - more of an engineering challenge :')\n\nThis is a multi faceted problem, but one of the large ones is propagating so many small attestation messages through such a large network in such a short period of time. At 1.1m validators, each subnet handles ~500 attestations per slot. Critically, the aggregators on these subnets need to see 66% of the votes in a reasonable amount of time for the chain to stablize. This is a lower bound though as 66% isn't really acceptable. We'd likely see highly sophisticated and well-resourced operators trend towards the \"fast enough\" 66% attesters, while under-resourced operators like home stakers fall outside -- not good.\n\nWe've spent a lot of time recently buffing up our observability at the p2p layer, and have some interesting data here. [I've just run some analysis on the last 24h of `missed slots` on Mainnet.](https://i.imgur.com/UHIrhpV.png) Missed slots are useful since all consensus clients release their attestations at the same time (4s) if they don't see a block. All of the instances here are running on attestation subnets `0` and `1` to filter out noise. Over this period, aggregated, it takes 780ms to propagate 66% of attestations, and 1960ms to hit 95%.\n\nThe challenge is obviously in that long tail - the attesters that are between p66 and p95. [We can actually see which entities are in there too](https://i.imgur.com/1rlHIjJ.png). This isn't weighted by stake or anything, so take it with a grain of salt, but interesting nonetheless. \n\nAttestations (and shorter slot times) haven't really been a focus until recently. Single Attestations occupy 4s of the 12s slot budget (with another 4s for aggregation!), and have been \"working\" since the beacon chain launched because of this generous budget. The good news is I personally think there is a lot of low hanging fruit in this space. For example: when we initially conducted the above analysis as a part of the 6s slot push for Glamsterdam we noticed that Kiln was disproportionately appearing in the long tail of attestations. Toni from the Prototyping team reached out and we saw a large improvement on the back of some changes they made to their infra (ty Kiln!). I fully expect that we'll find more of these. Not just in operator setups, but in clients, and the p2p layer itself."

In most cases, that\u2019s your Google or iCloud account handling the authentication, so you don\u2019t have to manually store or back up a seed phrase.\n\nIf you prefer not to rely on cloud accounts, you can also use a **hardware key manager like YubiKey**, which keeps the private key fully on the device.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that the key disappears \u2014 it\u2019s just a different model for how it\u2019s stored and authenticated, with options that can reduce the chance of users leaking or mishandling it."

NPM doesn't let you edit existing versions of your software, only publish new versions.\n\nSo an attacker can only compromise new versions by taking control of a dev's account. The software of every downstream dev who doesn't update to the new package version remains safe to this type of exploit.\n\nIdeally if you're developing a security sensitive package (like crypto), all your dependencies should be locked across builds and updated manually only. If your packages are never automatically updated, then there will always be a delay before you adopt a new dependency version (so the community can notify everyone)."

Sure there are those pulling 800% out of nowhere here and there, of those most of those fade right after, while the vast majority never blow and seem pretty much a dead end thus far.

      "Bro, bonk guy is extremely legit ... *extreeeeemely legit*. I call him Uni, sometimes because i noticed many of his friends on CT did. He explained that his username came from Uniswap and Pancakeswap.  \"The Uniswap and Pancakeswap guy\" isn't near as cool as BONK GUY.  Hence, his infamous trade you now know about. I mean dude called it too. And CT faded him. \n\nI have been following Uni on the solana blockchain and on CT (aka crypto twitter).  Twitter attacked his ass, everyone faded and kept fading, and fading.  And $bonk went on a absolute fucking tear! \"Bonk Guy was right\" - they all said. Holy shit man go and check for yourself. That's what makes crypto so damn much fun. And i know you know crypto, I'm speaking in generalities in case any normies are in here. They NEED to hear this too. \n\nUnfortunately (and fortunately) my situation with crypto didn't really start until Q3 of 2024. What bonk guy did drew me in.  And i was a bit skeptical at first, but all the data is there. All provable, on chain!!! Dude's a legend! \n\n  \nAND THIS IS WHY I AM HERE TYPING THIS RESPONSE.  *I BELIEVE IN BONK GUY!* MANY ALREADY DO!\n\nLook up any big \"crypto KOL\" on twitter and see if they have comments about Bonk Guy.  The fud spreaders are usually just paid attacks, sincerely. It's crypto for crying out loud - anything goes really in the wild west.   \nAnyway, check out, hell *ASK*, people like Ansem ([@blknoiz06](https://x.com/blknoiz06)).  He is a clear Bonk Guy supporter on the CT timeline.  I mean, it's fucking Ansem! Dude is a legend. Both bonk guy and Ansem have proven themeselves and their trades on chain and have mad respect for each other.  In crypto these dudes are a big mf-ing deal. \n\nAnyway. #USELESS coin is my ticket out of here. It should be yours too. It should be everyones.  But that's the beauty of Useless coin. There's no bullshit. Like EVERYTHING OTHER THAN BTC. i mean come on. BTC is gold. The rest are companies. Companis come and go. Let's ride teh golden memecoin. THE #USELESS COIN.  \n\n  \nAnd dude, i write. Im a shitty ass trader. Hence why i follow Uni / Bonk Guy.  Dude is so damn legit and his TA is spot on.  But again, im a writer. Not a trader.  Get it yet?\n\nHIGHER!!!"

Techdev highlighted the difficulty of maintaining 'diamond hands,' or strong risk tolerance, through Bitcoin's ups and downs. Many in the crypto industry agreed, noting that most early investors either sold too soon, lost access to wallets, or spent their Bitcoin. Holding long-term requires exceptional discipline and conviction.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."

Traditionally, Bitcoin's price would peak post-halving, followed by a significant crash, but recent trends show deviations. Analysts suggest the cycle's predictability is diminishing, with reduced volatility and institutional investments stabilizing the market. Experts believe the era of 70-80% crashes may be over, replaced by milder corrections of 30-50%.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

So yes, if the of USD entered hyperinflation, bitcoin price would appreciate against it because each new USD is now worth 90% less.\n\nOf course, the bitcoin price would also crash because the US is a huge percentage of the crypto market and that would be a huge loss in buying power.

      "Back in June, I kept receiving email and in-app notifications about how my web3 wallet funds in coinbase's then \"Wallet\" app needs to be moved into my main Coinbase balance due to upcoming upgrade. So I **followed the prompt in the Coinbase app to copy the address**, and sent over my eth (~0.4 eth) from my wallet in the then \u201cwallet\u201d app into \u201cCoinbase\u201d app. This transaction happened on July 3rd, and I confirmed it after* seeing balance appear in my main Coinbase app*, within the same week I came back to the app numerous times and saw balance each time i visited. I then forgot about i, since I don't really actively trade.\n\nThen fast forward to today, randomly i decide to check on the app with ETH going up and saw my balance is now showing 0. The source of the issue is that coinbase generates an address for transactions but the recipient address generated by Coinbase earlier is now for some reasons no longer tied to my account, and I can see on eth scanner that the same amount of eth is sitting in the same address, untouched.\n\nI then contacted Coinbase support, and was given some **very fishy** response: (**Case #24184256**):\n\n* First I was told that the reason why I am not seeing it is because of delay, as the \"transaction needs enough confirmation on the blockchain to be completed\". I responded that (1) there is no way an eth transfer takes more than 40 days to complete, (2) I already saw the balance in my Coinbase app before and (3) the transaction status is marked completed 39 days ago\n* After I pushed back, the agent responded by saying actually unfortunately the address is not tied to my account, I responded that this address is generated in Coinbase app and I clearly saw the balance before.\n* Then after 10 minutes, she said she \u201cchecked with the team\u201d and the address is actually still associated with my account, and it\u2019s just not visible for some reasons. I should just \u201cplease trust them I will receive the fund and I should just wait\u201d (after 40 days?)\n* I pushed back by saying I need an explanation as to why funds can just disappear from my account and addresses can just disconnect randomly, and an ETA on when this will be restored, i was then never given a response. Another agent then jumped in, I repeated the explanation but as she was investigating why this address got disconnected with my account, she promised she\u2019s getting an update, but suddenly force closed my case after 20 mins.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as I start to push back on the first agent, on help.coinbase.com/en page whenever the agent is active I kept getting forced logged out - every time a message pops up that requires me to respond, my response will be failed to sent and upon refresh it would show that I am logged out for some reasons. And while I was gone, the agent would ask many times whether I am still connected, as if she would like to see me disconnected to be able to close the case; when this was transitioned to a new agent, the issue disappeared.\n\nSince my case was force closed, I started another case #24185822, and was essentially given the same merry-go-around, oddly, the agent also disconnected while promising me she's looking into why this address got unlinked. And the subsequent agent was also not able to help. \n\nDue to how dodgy and inaccurate the responses were, I have two hypothesis:\n\n* **Customer Support Limitation** - the agents are either actually AI, or given too little access to tools, or under too much KPI pressure to provide actual help; i went through a total of 4 agents back to back, all of them would ask me the same type of basic questions or questions i've already answered. They were clearly outsourced and working on multiple cases at any given time. \n* **Potential Coinbase data breach / incident** - the account was generated by Coinbase, they still have fund custody in this address, there was no transaction at all on any associated accounts. If I were to guess this all points to either internal system failure - either a database system migration gone wrong or some security incident that caused them to lose address-to-account mapping for some customers, potentially tied to the whole migration associated with their wallet / base app. \n\n**Bottom line is this, before today, I did not even expect to face this type of issue with a publicly traded company I used to trust.** I was never expecting to tippy toeing on a \"legit\" platform like Coinbase, if things like this can just randomly happen without clear resolution and explanation, then their mission \u201cwe are deeply focused on solving our customers\u2019 problems with technology\u201d sounds very much like a joke and it\u2019s hard to separate them from any other smaller more suspicious exchanges. \n\nI have screenshots of all these conversations because it felt sus. Now I am out of options besides escalating this with their execs or government agencies, it absolutely sucks but I am just glad I didn't put my life savings or a larger investment on this platform, because now I sure as hell don't have the trust to do that."

Concerns arose on social media about potential impacts on self-custodial wallets, but Google confirmed these wallets are exempt from the policy, alleviating fears among crypto users.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

The new rules include robust cold-wallet infrastructure, private key controls, third-party assessments, and 24/7 security monitoring. These standards will serve as the baseline for a future licensing regime for standalone virtual asset custodians, aiming to foster a trusted digital asset ecosystem.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

It powers stablecoins, NFTs, and tokenized assets, offering unmatched security and developer support. Ethereum's staking rewards and protocol-driven scarcity create a unique yield-plus-appreciation loop. As usability improves, Ethereum is set to replace traditional financial systems, with its market cap potentially surpassing $3 trillion by 2030.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

      "You are right that most blockchains either centralize to scale or push most of the work off chain, which kills the decentralization they claim to have. The difference is ICP was designed from the ground up to handle complex, compute-intensive applications on chain without offloading the core logic or state to a central authority. Its subnet architecture and orthogonal persistence let it scale while keeping the entire stack on chain and under decentralized governance. DFINITY is also actively working on roadmap milestones like Flux, Magnetosphere, and Solenoid to make ICP faster and more efficient while expanding decentralization at the same time. That is why it can run things like AI models or full web apps entirely on chain in practice, which no other major blockchain is doing."

AI is refined input, it helps to clarify an idea if the user takes the time to use it properly, it works the same as passing your work to somepne else for proofing except its done with computer learning. It's not difficult to tell if someone used one sentence to prompt or had an ongoing dialogue to refine a valid perception or information."

      "BTCXAU-Chart suggests Bitcoin hasnt really approached a new ATH in adjusted terms. Of course one could also normalize for M2 supply but tbh, using the value of gold makes more sense because it better deflects on the market's perception of asset inflation.\n\nAs most of the times, BTC will take the path of most pain, which naturally is the path opposite to what most market participants expect. And the big narrative is: BTC is going to top in Q4 2025, then a bear market starts. This narrative was also present, but much more controversial in Q4 of 2021.\n\nThe longer we stay in the $110-120k area and the longer a sideway movement with low volatility, the more likely it is people lose faith and interest. This will eventually lead to a continuation of the bull market. If euphoria sets in because of stupid political shenanigans for example, a quick surge followed by a blow-off top become more likely. Altought right now, it certainly looks like the top is already in. But who cares, really? The year 2028 and especially 2032 and beyond is more more interesting."

      "The stuff you mentioned is just scratching the surface honestly. I work at an engineering consultancy and we see this convergence happening in ways most people aren't thinking about yet.  \n  \nMEV protection is getting huge. AI models can predict and counter frontrunning attacks in real time by analyzing mempool patterns and transaction flows. Our clients building DEX infrastructure are using this to protect their users from sandwich attacks and other MEV extraction.  \n  \nCross chain bridge security is another area where AI makes sense. Training models on historical bridge exploits and transaction patterns to detect when someone's trying to manipulate oracle feeds or exploit timing differences between chains. The multichain world is creating attack vectors that humans can't monitor effectively.  \n  \nAutomated market making is evolving beyond simple algorithms. AI agents that can adjust liquidity provision strategies based on market volatility, gas prices, and even social sentiment. We've built systems that can pull liquidity during high volatility periods and redeploy when conditions stabilize.  \n  \nPrivacy preserving AI inference on blockchain data is interesting too. Using zero knowledge proofs to run AI models on encrypted transaction data without revealing the underlying information. Useful for compliance monitoring where you need to detect patterns but can't expose actual transaction details.  \n  \nDecentralized compute for AI training is getting traction. Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers, distributing model training across blockchain networks. The incentive structures work well and it's more censorship resistant than traditional approaches.  \n  \nThe regulatory compliance angle is massive. AI systems that can automatically generate audit trails, detect potential violations, and even submit regulatory reports based on on chain activity. Our customers in DeFi are starting to need this as regulations get clearer.  \n  \nMost teams are still thinking about AI and crypto as separate domains but the real innovation happens when you architect them together from the ground up. The composability of both technologies creates possibilities that neither can achieve alone."

The plan includes reducing the tax rate on crypto gains from a maximum of 55% to a flat 20%, aligning it with traditional financial assets like stocks. It also aims to eliminate taxes on unrealized corporate crypto gains, reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products, and potentially approve Bitcoin spot ETFs. These changes, supported by the Liberal Democratic Party and industry advocates, aim to boost investment, foster innovation, and position Japan as a leader in digital finance.\n\n*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

      "Oh god...\n\nSo, 'buying the top' refers to buying at the highest price in a market cycle. It has no where to go but down. Look at the charts, you see how they have peaks and valleys? You would be buying a peak right now, or, close to it. So next, is a valley. \n\nA buffered position in stocks is an investment strategy that uses options to limit a portfolio's potential losses, or \"buffer\" the downside, over a specific period. This downside protection comes with a trade-off: a \"cap\" on the maximum potential gains. This strategy is most commonly implemented through\u00a0buffered exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nFor example, I just put a bunch of money into a buffered position that is indexed to the SP500. The position has a 20% buffer, is capped at 10% gains, and matures in like 9 months. It was a 15 month contract. \n\nSo, if I hold for the full 15 months, and the index goes down 21%, I only lose 1%. However, if I don't hold it until maturity, I lose the full 21%. Now, if at any time, the position moves up 10% or more, I can sell it, take my profit, and buy into another buffered position. \n\nThis is a good strategy to get into a market that is really hot, maybe at, or near, ATH's. Does this all make sense? You are protected on the downside, but you've got to let the contract mature. If you hit your gains limit, you can sell it too. You don't need to hold it until maturity to take gains. You do need to hold it till maturity to get the downside protection though. \n\nThere is a new BTC buffered ETF that I believe just hit the market, or will hit the market soon. It offers downside protection, which, you might want if you'll be lumping in at the top of a market cycle."

You just want your statements to be taken at face value, but I am not sure that's so easy. \n\nThis is such a well-known and basic fact, that if you didn't know this then you know practically nothing about either Tether or Ethereum and I recommend shutting up about it so you don't embarrass yourself further. If you really need a fucking source, maybe check their own website: https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=usdt\n\nAs for their collateral, again this has nothing to do with anything but you keep yapping about it so I feel the need to point out that their bitcoin holdings is a tiny, tiny portion of their total collateral and it's absolutely not something they rely on. And for good reason, it is far too unstable and unreliable to serve as a collateral for a stablecoin, it would be gambling with their customer's money. If the customers needed to rely on bitcoin for their stablecoin to hold its value, then what was the point of the stablecoin in the first place? Nothing, obviously."

No public market or anyway out through CEX or DEX. The team won't even let them swap them out.\n\nHolders have fake gains on their dashboard and X wallets... Fake digital numbers with no real or claimable funds or returns.\n\nI \"supposedly\" have over\u00a0$100K, from 5k+ coins in my wallet and over\u00a0$200k, from 15k coins staked in the release pool.. but they have only sold 1.72 coins worth\u00a0$21.36 after months and months of waiting.\n\nIt's been over 3 years going to 4+ and I still haven not made any returns from this. Yet the L1X Team is able to sell and make profit from doing more presales, fundraisers, and selling Wrapped L1X coins.\n\nThe Team Profits at every step while OG investors are stuck within their Contracts and Honey Pot centralized Ecosystem with no way out!!! Big Scam!!\u00a0[\\#Scam](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/Scam/top/)\u00a0[\\#scammerteam](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/scammerteam/top/)\u00a0[\\#Layeronex](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/Layeronex/top/)\u00a0[\\#L1X](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/topics/L1X/top/)"

A lot of \"news\" outlets have tried to downplay it or not mention it at all. Fear? Bias? Dunno. But it's notable."

The experts say Trump's economic policies are the sole contributor to recession fears now,  and an article from 2020 also highlights the convergence of the 18 year housing bubble cycle aligning with it. \n\nMy understanding is that Trump wants to trigger the recession on purpose and that the high valuation of the markets leading up to the pop are simply people preparing for maximum rugpull. Prices are high,  retail and middle class have very little in the way of purchasing power. His entire crypto venture netted him about 2.5 billion in profit,  and he's never going to be satisfied.  \n\nTo him, crypto is a means to getting richer,  by devaluing the dollar which affects retail and middle class the most, and crypto was his way of parking his wealth until it's over."

The consensus rules still apply: an OP_RETURN output can only be up to about 10,000 bytes, a transaction up to about 100,000 virtual bytes, and blocks are still limited to about 4 megabytes weight.\n\nWhat changes is only the default relay policy. Nodes running Core will now forward larger OP_RETURN transactions by default. If you prefer the old behavior you can still turn off OP_RETURN relay or keep the old size limit in your settings. These options are being deprecated but they are still available in v30.\n\nRunning a pruned node also means you do not keep all historical block data forever, so you are not forced to store every piece of arbitrary content on disk. Bitcoin Knots uses stricter defaults for relaying, but just like Core it accepts all valid blocks under the consensus rules. Bitcoin is not suddenly becoming a storage chain, and users can choose how their own node handles data relay."

      "Working at a platform that designs decentralized and ML-driven systems and we've been helping clients build on Base since it launched. The technical fundamentals are solid but there are some real trade-offs to consider.\n\nBase is basically Coinbase's attempt to own the L2 narrative while keeping transaction fees reasonable. For developers it's pretty straightforward since it's just Optimism under the hood with Coinbase's infrastructure backing it. We've deployed smart contracts there for several customers and the developer experience is clean, gas costs are way lower than mainnet Ethereum, and bridging assets is smooth.\n\nThe real advantage is the Coinbase integration. If you're building something that needs fiat onramps or you want access to Coinbase's user base, Base makes sense. Our clients who are doing consumer-facing DeFi apps love that users can fund wallets directly from their Coinbase accounts without dealing with bridge complexity.\n\nThat said, the ecosystem is still pretty thin compared to Polygon or Arbitrum. Less liquidity, fewer established protocols, and you're basically betting on Coinbase's long-term commitment to the platform. We've seen companies get burned when centralized players change priorities.\n\nThe \"Everything App\" marketing is typical Coinbase overpromising. They're trying to be the WeChat of crypto but honestly most of our customers just use Base for specific use cases, not as some all-encompassing platform.\n\nFor newcomers, Base is actually pretty good because the Coinbase connection makes onboarding less of a clusterfuck. But if you're serious about DeFi or building complex applications, you probably want to start on mainnet or Arbitrum where there's more established infrastructure.\n\nSecurity reviews aren't optional if you're serious about scaling on any L2, but Base's architecture is battle-tested since it's just Optimism with different branding. The main risk is Coinbase-specific, not technical."

      "???? Do you think that ETH sets its network parameters based on people voting with their ETH or something?????? How are you saying that control of ETH means control of how the network operates????\n\nDude it's exactly like Bitcoin where software developers and the community agree (WITHOUT USING CRYPTO) on what changes to make to the network. They then write code and update node/mining/staking software to reflect those changes and then the community must all decide to run the new software changes for the changes to take effect. The amount of BTC or ETH you hold has no bearing at all on what changes get agreed upon....\n\nYou know that Bitcoin has hard forks too right?? You know that a group of people control fundamental network properties of Bitcoin? https://www.investopedia.com/tech/history-bitcoin-hard-forks/\n\nIt's funny you bring up pre-mine because Satisho holds almost 2 million Bitcoin.... This is besides the point though because you seem to think control of supply equates to control of how the blockchain operates (hint: IT DOESN'T).\n\nYou really think that when you stake ETH on Coinbase nothing happens and you just reap the rewards? Bro come on. Coinbase runs validators and participates in PoS on your behalf. They validate transactions, they produce blocks, they attest to blocks. Validators run 24/7 and prevent any malicious activity on the network.\n\nPoW miners can repurpose their energy supply. They can repurpose their mining hardware (except ASICs). They can easily stop mining whenever they want and do something else. Miners can act maliciously and just walk away with no consequences. Look at the recent Monero attack. They're just going to re-purpose all their compute for other attacks or they'll just go back to mining legitimately. If PoS validators stop performing their services or act maliciously, they literally have their funds taken. And yes, miners are incentived to secure the network just like validators. What's your point?"

Neither of these 2 have broke those highs yet. I firmly believe we are in the disbelief part of the market cycle. Lot of short side liquidity up for grabs up to 124k. Billions worth/ mass adoption/mass buying from etfs/governments/companies. Study some comparisons of market sentiment/ behavior to roaring 20s/dotcom. Nobody truly knows how high it will go but never take all the chips off the table or you'll regret it for the rest of your life. I've been very vocal about this on X and see polar opposite sentiment blasted everywhere screaming for 95k and crashes all over. Quite intriguing the doubt the masses will have on a speculative asset as such. This market psychology dates all the way back to the \"tulip mania\" back in the day. More recently examples were Nvda. Been reading posts/sentiment about nvda since it was a few hundred billion dollar mc and look where it is at now.  I remain bullish with confirmation of this with a break over the listed highs on volume. Many folks line in the sand was 110k which was about 10% off the highs. Naturally market makers pulled it below to trap shorts and now it's running towards the next largest liquidity. Hope the offers some sort of help and congrats on the bags!"

      "SPX6900 is the winner so far. It should continue...Take a look at [cryptobubbles.net](http://cryptobubbles.net) and click on the \"year\" tab. The strategy is to find the coin with the most diehard community and SPX is quite simply the best. Come see it for yourself and gain your own conviction. Buy a coin and come hang out in Spaces on X, watch Flipping the Stock Market podcast on Apple, Spotify, etc. There is a book written about SPX as well, on Amazon. Murad's Token 2049 talk is also well worth watching: [https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=-iareDdfHHmNprun](https://youtu.be/6nqzwdGxTGc?si=-iareDdfHHmNprun) SPX is his favorite of course. Hope this helps!"

The \"digitizing the stock market\" is too big of a thing, even if it ends up vaporware.  It's a good story.\n\nI missed the boat on alts, I missed the boat on MSTR.  BMNR is Tom Lee's ETH treasury company and, if we're about to have any sort of mania or leg-up, I expect the story/hype/euphoria to find its way there pronto.  The dude has been shilling BTC and ETH daily on the bloomberg channels and, frankly, he's great at it.  Having made the correct bullish calls these past 6 months doesn't hurt either.\n\nI'm a story guy.  This is a good story.  It will resonate with \"the people\", so I'm in.\n\nGoing forward, I believe there will be exactly two winners in this space; BTC and ETH.  BTC because trustless, scarce digital gold.  We all know why.  ETH because it's the backbone for all the defi, stablecoins, fancy schmancy stuff that's yet to come.  All others go to zero IMO.\n\nI have never been able to reconcile the enormous supply of ETH and why it should have value; it's much more straightforward with BTC.

Then you can leverage BTC even more which will continue until hyperbitcoinization. \n\nBasically BTC up leverage ratio goes down and you can leverage up again and again up to safe leverage ratios.\n\nNot to mention as MSTR goes up it gets more passive flows from indices leading to even more capital to buy BTC via ATM and increase the base BTC even more enabling further leverage. \n\nSo 10 years of 30% CAGR in BTC and debt at an average of 8% let's them grow their assets base 22% a year. \n\nThe amount they can grow depends on how much Capital they can raise via debt. They are primarily targeting the bond market and the money market categories. 1% of 300T ie 3T to buy BTC can definitely do the job. Let's say 1M BTC is 10 years away. They buy at an average price of 500k. That's 2M more BTC over 10 years.. \nThe limiting factor will be that they can't lever up past 50%."

      "Hey Guys... dumb fiat MSTR investing question BTC adjacent.\n\nFirstly lets say you are already fully allocated toward bitcoin, and are looking for a return on your fiat while your cold hodl matures.\n\nWould it be reasonable to rotate in and out of STRC and STRF (or really any 2 dividend producing stocks with different ex-dividend dates)?  Seems like you could get ~16% annually by staying in STRC for the off months and then switching into STRF (or another quarterly dividend) before the ex-dividend data to double dip?  Obviously you would forgo the STRC dividend on those quarterly months.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nApologies if this is too outside the realm of BTC trading."

There is no doubt that from current levels your investing group could trade this and make a huge profit. But it\u2019s a trade and not an investment. There is literally no use case for Pepe or utility. It\u2019s all about community, but in crypto that makes a difference. So, for me I am holding the Pepe I have with an eye on the charts \ud83d\udcca to try and exit with profits once I believe we are in euphoria and the end stage of this cycle."

Even the legislative branch has passed some crypto bills on stable coins. 50% of stable coin market built on ETH.\n\n- Eth leads alt coins seasons. \n\nSeems like the perfect storm for a strong price discovery for eth and so probably alt coins too. Especially L2s on ETH.\n\nBut I'm also thinking this time is different. Fomo retail has been burned, probably twice now for coming in late and been left holding the bag for months or years. Only recovering fully very recently if they held through it all. They may not come back in the same way as before but who knows. \n\nWe're getting close to ath so nearly all eth holders are currently in profit. That's a lot of selling pressure about to hit soon as well. If eth comes down, alts are probably coming down hard too."

      ">You read articles, and take is as truth. You are weak minded. Think for yourself.\n\nIt is not an article, is me replying to someone with the same arguments you present.\n\n>Bitcoins security in the far far future ( why it's silly to call this a crisis) does spark debate within the community and has for many years. The question of what will happen when the block subsidy stops or becomes incredibly small, who will support and secure the network? As the subsidy becomes smaller, transaction fees will have to take a larger roll. There are many cases made where this could easily be the case and work out, there are cases that prove otherwise. I for one think fees can contribute enough but this is not just a black and white situation with a yes or no answer. This goes beyond you eth maxis. This answer also heavily depends on the price and adoption of Bitcoin in the far future. To say it's already failed is so incredibly naive.  \n\nTX fees are 1% of current issuance. \n\nYou understand that even if BTC reacts, it can only do what ETH has already done. It can only play catch-up. Both chains have to pay for security, pretending you can stop printing is just not possible - so your best bet is minimal viable issuance, which is to say you always pay for security, but then any time you have fees, you can offset it with burn. The fact that Ethereum already did this is why it is a better a SOV. **It does not need to change, while Bitcoin does.** \n\n**\"Having an uncertain monetary policy is not a good one\" - EXACTLY.** You even misunderstand WHY it is good - being changeable is not the problem - that is in fact optimal, as long as the social contract is that you only change the issuance DOWN, i.e. make the monetary policy BETTER. \n\nOn top of that, even if it changes, as I have already said, POW requires more subsidy; you have to pay electricity and hardware costs of miners, or they won't mine. This is much less capitally efficient than POS - it is both less secure and less scarce than Ethereum is, and that will forever be the case.\n\nYou've been lied to, DYOR."

      "It is quite simple. Now we have stablecoins like EUROC that are provided by circle. The problem is that the prpmise of value (that the EUROC is worth exactly one euro) depends solely on Circle. If they go down or they do something shady or they have some problems the EUROC might lose its peg.\n\nWhat digital Euro has to offer is that it won't be pegged to 1 Euro. It will be 1 Euro. Whatever happens it will be worth 1 Euro by law. Just like cash - whatever happens on the world your 5 Euro bill will be worth 5 Euro\n\nSo as I understand it for now the biggest advantage is the stability and peace of mind.\n\nAlso a lot of people talk about the privacy and freedom concerns. Those are valid points but on the other hand we now have Circle that controls everything that is happening with your USDC and EUROC. They can (and I am sure they do) track how you use your coins and block some actions that they don't like. So to be honest I might even prefer ECB over some private company when it comes to who can control my money"

Price is not moving up and even though there will be a huge adoption because of StableCoins (Genius ACT, Digital Euro) it still doesn't make a lot of sense to consider it an investment. The same way as you can't consider holding Cash an investment. I don't see people going and buying tons of USD or Euro and calling it an investment. It's just cash. Somehow most crypto bro's like you prefer to call people stupid instead of looking into why crypto is a Ponzi scheme. And yeah I'm aware of the paper returns yet ETH is known to fail 80% on corrections name another \"investment\" known to fail 80% on corrections.

I see where people might be a little worried about \"confusing the newbies\" about how good security is done. \n\nBut the coin itself says 0.01 Eth (call it $45) so I don't think its terribly crazy to just risk it. \nThe coin itself is beautiful and a fun conversation piece and display item. Probably worth at least $20 in craftsmanship by itself. \n\nIt's beautiful, it's fun, it's got sort of similar vibes to a \"challenge coin\" \n\nI'm assuming the \"Finite By Design\" is the coin manufacturer's brand, and not supposed to be a reference to ETH."

      "Hey, I'm as excited as the next XRP Army member, but we need to keep in mind that the old-school thinking banks are banding together to STOP Ripple from gaining a banking licence and Federal Reserve master acct. If Ripple suceeds, which I hope they do, traditional banks will lose billions if dollars in revenue if they don't embrace the new tech and work WITH Ripple.\n\nWith the SEC case being over for good, I'm hoping it's not too late for XRP to explode over the coming years and as ETF's gain approval and adoption.  I'm hoping the damage done to XRP from that lame SEC case has not allowed others to build other sysyems to compete."

It's also a mastercard so no idea why people are making a big deal out of this new \"XRP Card\" when it's ran by Gemini anyway.\n\nYou're better off just getting a Chase card or something like that and just straight up buying XRP with another account. The Gemini app is pretty terrible. It does a TERRIBLE job at showing you basic information about your credit cards account. I still can't change my rewards back to XRP for two weeks now...the app simply just does not work correctly.\n\nI'll be locking my card and hiding it in my house somewhere simply to keep the credit on my account. If you do get this card just use it for gas as that gives the most rewards. Also what they don't mention flat out is that the rewards are capped at 300 dollars worth of crypto rewards per month. They can also close out your account for literally no reason, it's in the fine print. Do some searching, there's plenty of posts of people having thousands to tens of thousands of money locked up in an account they can't access and Gemini won't do anything about it."

The entire process is enforced by the XRP Ledger's code and is publicly auditable on the blockchain. This means Ripple cannot arbitrarily release more XRP than the programmed schedule allows. The only reason we even know that is because of how transparent they are. \n\nThey understand the spirit of decentralization, and thats obviously a target they aim to hit over time as escrow drains, but their main priority at the time was to facilitate instantaneous low-cost transactions. That required a pre-mined coin when they built the ledger. They came up with the escrow idea to make it transparent what they were doing because you shrills were bitching about centralization back then too. It becomes more decentralized over time.\n\nThe coin has seen more growth in value in the last year than almost any other cryptocurrency on the market, yet you doubt its ability to hit valuations it was engineered to reach. That's ridiculous. But hey, I get it: nay-saying is risk-free."

      "Okay! Let\u2019s say you want to buy $50,000 of something called XRP, but you don\u2019t want to buy it all at once. Instead, you want to spread it out over time, like buying a little bit of candy each week instead of a whole big bag at once. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging, or DCA. It\u2019s a smart way to buy things like XRP because the price can go up and down a lot, and this helps you avoid buying when it\u2019s super expensive.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it, super simple:\n\n1. **Pick a Plan**: Decide how much time you want to spread your $50,000 over. Let\u2019s say you want to buy over 10 weeks. That means you\u2019ll spend $5,000 each week ($50,000 \u00f7 10 = $5,000).\n\n2. **Choose a Place to Buy**: You need a special app or website called an \u201cexchange\u201d to buy XRP, like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. It\u2019s like a store for digital money. You sign up, add your bank card, and you\u2019re ready to go!\n\n3. **Set a Schedule**: Every week (or month, or whatever you pick), you buy $5,000 worth of XRP. For example, every Monday, you log in and buy $5,000 of XRP, no matter if the price is high or low.\n\n4. **Buy the XRP**: When you buy, the exchange will tell you how much XRP you get for your $5,000. If XRP costs $0.50, you\u2019d get 10,000 XRP ($5,000 \u00f7 $0.50). If the price changes to $0.40 next week, you\u2019d get 12,500 XRP for the same $5,000. Cool, right?\n\n5. **Keep Going**: Do this every week for 10 weeks. By the end, you\u2019ll have spent $50,000 and own a bunch of XRP. Since you bought at different prices, you won\u2019t lose as much if the price drops, and you\u2019ll still do great if the price goes up!\n\n6. **Store It Safely**: After buying, keep your XRP safe in a \u201cdigital wallet,\u201d like a special app or device, so nobody can take it.\n\nThat\u2019s it! By buying a little each week, you\u2019re being super smart and safe with your money, like saving up your allowance for a big toy. Want me to explain anything else?"

Supply and demand.  Supply economics are complicated in crypto because it's highly fragmented, but it's a critical metric.  The MAIN reason BTC is so expensive is because of its scarcity.  ETH has numerous variables that affect supply economics: ETH locked in Staking, lost ETH, and, of course, ETH holders.  How much supply is in exchanges/OTC exchanges is what determines price. \n\nIf ETH hits $1 trillion market cap it will be over $8k.  Is this doable?  Sure seems like it, but sell pressure on ETH goes up with the price, bag holders take profits.  Don't expect a parabolic move in a short time period, but a $1 trillion market cap is very possible."

This design preserves safety under validator churn and partial network faults while maintaining sub-second deterministic finality in optimal network conditions.\n\n\u2022\tScalability Architecture: Employs parallelized transaction execution with ordered commit protocols, allowing disjoint transaction sets to be processed concurrently while retaining a unified global state root. Avoids traditional sharding pitfalls such as cross-shard messaging complexity or security dilution.\n\n\u2022\tAnchor Subsystem: Anchors are protocol-level primitives that perform asset custody, off-chain verification, and on-chain token issuance/redemption. Asset state is cryptographically bound to custody attestations, enabling provable 1:1 backing for RWAs and fiat representations.\n\n\u2022\tCompliance Integration: Identity attestations and rule sets for KYC, AML, and FATF Travel Rule compliance are enforced at the transaction layer, ensuring that all protocol interactions can meet jurisdictional regulatory requirements without third-party middleware.\n\n\u2022\tInteroperability Layer: Native cross-chain messaging and settlement pathways allow anchors and participants to bridge assets between Keeta and external L1/L2 ecosystems, providing interoperability without external bridge contracts as single points of failure.\n\n\u2022\tTokenomics & Supply Mechanics: $KTA features deterministic emission schedules with programmed supply compression events, creating periodic liquidity constraints (\u201csupply shocks\u201d) that can amplify demand pressures in adoption phases."

      "To the best of my knowledge, HOME works differently from most crypto. Instead of following the ups and downs of Bitcoin or Ethereum, its value comes from a bunch of real-world mortgages. It\u2019s essentially like a REIT (real estate investment trust) version of crypto, moving more like slow, steady housing debt than the highly volatile crypto market.\n\nThe risk is you are trusting a small team to manage those mortgages, collect payments, and handle any defaults. If the housing market tanks, people stop paying, or the loans are not as solid as advertised, the backing for the token takes a hit. It is kind of like a mini version of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from the 2008 crash. Back then, bad or risky loans were bundled together, sold as safe, and when the housing market went south, the whole thing collapsed.\n\nThe mortgages are tied to the cryptocurrency through the protocol\u2019s structure. When investors buy HOME with stablecoins like USDC, that money is used to fund or refinance real-world home loans. Those loans are secured by liens, which are legal claims on the properties. The details of those liens and the cash flow from mortgage payments are managed on a blockchain.\n\nIn short, each token represents a share of a pool of mortgages, and the blockchain serves as the ledger that tracks ownership and payouts. As long as the underlying mortgages remain solid and the housing market stays stable, the structure can work as intended."

Also just look online for the 4 year cycle, no one really is sure itll always happen but its good to read about it, basically its the idea of capital rotating from BTC to ETH to smaller and snaller cap coins.

Do not sell the dips. Timing the market is impossible. People that say that they can are lying. Markets are level 2 chaos systems. Predictions change the outcome.\n\nNext learn about what a clearing house is. That is what a blockchain solves in a decentralized manner. Once you understand that you will see clearly as to why bitcoin is going to be taking over.\n\nNext learn about private keys, how to store them securely. If you get 3x more than a hardware wallet is worth, get one. Because soon that 3x number is going to turn into a 100x number.\n\n  \nThen understand the data structure of bitcoin. Why sha256 is secure and why proof of work works.\n\nThen learn why bitcoin is a protocol and why the world only needs one blockchain. Just like the world needs one internet.\n\nThen you will sleep soundly.\n\nGetting into bitcoin requires you to learn a few skills, but anyone can get into the basics.\n\nAvoid the pump and dump schemes.

You can either code and deploy, or you can launch on pumpfun , and final you can launch on Dex without need of Migration.\n\n1 : Launch using Pumpfun.\n\n\\- one can launch using pumpfun with ease and cheap. its costs only 0.2 sol for launch . well launching is easy the real pain starts when no one buys apart from couple of sniper bots and those bots will sell within seconds leaving your chart dry. SOLUTION - either you should do marketing for your coin launch, you must be able gather people to show interest and build hype for launch. or next option is to use bundler tool and volume tool which gives intial pump and chart push. Well from here if coin hits certain and market cap and finishes bonding curve it will be migrate to Dexscreener.\n\n2 Dex Launch without Migration :\n\n\\- well you can use third party launchers ( DYOR , lot of drainers ) , where you can launch directly onto dex , after creating coin on third party tool, you can add initial liquidity , the moment you add liquidity , a price will be set and coin can be started trading. Again you can use marketing for promotion or any other volume or bundler tools for initial price push and volume push.  \n  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like, Bitcoin ETFs are already a big deal\u2026 but an ETH ETF that actually pays out staking rewards? That feels like a whole different level of regulatory challenge.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious what people here think:\n\n* Do you think the SEC will ever allow an Ethereum ETF that distributes staking rewards? Or is that a step too far for them?\n* And if something like BlackRock or Fidelity actually launched one, would it kill DeFi staking (since institutions could stake \u201csafely\u201d), or would it onboard a completely new class of investors into ETH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "In my opinion investing in crypto is easy if you make it easy for yourself. There is alot of bs everywhere and even more scam projects because of crypto\u2019s nature. What i have been doing the last 10 years is look at projects that are actually going to make something and provide value. Sure you can make alot of money with some meme coin but this is like gambling. Find a project you are interested in and figure out what they are doing, how they are doing it, when they are going to be able to deliver their product. Get in touch with devs via telegram or whatever channel they use. The devs want you to invest so always take what they say with a grain of salt but there are a couple of projects that are actually trying to be legit and these could deliver great returns but its definitley not short term. You want to hop in early as one of the first and keep in touch with the community to see where its heading."

They hold billions in reserves, but users have to trust corporate custodians, attestations, and opaque banking relationships.\n\nNow Avalanche has introduced **AUSD**, the **first fully DAO-governed stablecoin**. Here\u2019s what makes it different:\n\n* **Community governance:** Parameters like collateral ratios and accepted assets are set by DAO votes, not corporate executives.\n* **Over-collateralized:** Every $1 AUSD is backed by at least $1.50 worth of crypto.\n* **On-chain audits:** Reserves are transparently visible and updated in real time.\n* **Avalanche speed:** Built on AVAX, the system benefits from fast finality and low fees.\n\nThis could be a game-changer for DeFi. Instead of trusting a company in New York or offshore, users can trust code and community governance.\n\nOf course, questions remain: Can AUSD scale enough to challenge USDT/USDC? And how will regulators respond to a stablecoin with no centralized issuer to subpoena?\n\nFull deep dive here \ud83d\udc49 [hodlhorizon.com/news/dao-stablecoin-launch-avalanche](https://hodlhorizon.com/news/dao-stablecoin-launch-avalanche?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 is DAO governance the future of stablecoins, or will regulators crush this before it gains traction?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "The fact that you\u2019re asking that question probably means your gut is picking up on something. When projects look like they\u2019re \u201cabout to moon,\u201d it\u2019s usually either a legit narrative run or the setup for a classic rug. The hard part is telling which is which in the moment.\n\nA few red flags I personally watch for:\n\n* **Liquidity depth**: If volume is spiking but liquidity is shallow, insiders can pull the plug easily.\n* **Token distribution**: Heavy concentration in a few wallets = big risk.\n* **Dev/Team transparency**: If nobody knows who\u2019s behind it or the roadmap is just memes, tread carefully.\n* **Utility vs hype**: Narrative pumps can make money, but long-term survival comes from actual use cases.\n\nAt the same time, sometimes the sketchy coins do moon short-term. It just comes down to whether you\u2019re trading or investing. If you\u2019re trading, set stops and don\u2019t marry the bag. If you\u2019re investing, make sure the fundamentals line up with your thesis.\n\nOn a practical note, if you\u2019re worried about getting stuck in one ecosystem when chasing plays, multi-chain swap tools like Rubic make it easier to hop in/out across chains without being tied down to sketchy bridges. That\u2019s saved me a couple of times when hype tokens only existed on one network.\n\nIf you do ape in, maybe size it like it\u2019s already lost. That way you\u2019re not wrecked if it rugs. Do you see this as a short-term gamble, or are you actually considering holding it longer?"

It monitors 1-minute, 3-minute, and 5-minute candles, picking up unusual moves and displaying them on a dark-themed, no-signup dashboard. You can even toggle sound alerts to get notified instantly no need to stare at charts all day.\r\n\r\nWhat stood out:\r\nNo friction just open your browser and go; no login or fees.\r\nMinimalist and practical, unlike bulky desktop apps or scripts.\r\nUses a simple delta and volume anomaly algorithm, with optional audio cues when, say, price change \u2265 3%.\r\n\r\nClickable tickers let you jump straight to Binance Futures charts.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon it yesterday evening and posted the link received a few comments and it stayed up through early morning, which I take as a good sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought this might be useful for anyone wanting to catch rapid moves\u2014pumps, dumps, volume surges\u2014without loading down their system\r\n\r\nQuestion for the group:\r\nDo tools like this actually help filter out noise and improve reaction time?\r\n\r\nWhat features would you find valuable like more customization, mobile alerts, token filters, or clearer visual cues?\r\n\r\nHas anyone used similar pump/dump scanners\u2014how did they compare?.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As a beginner, you would probably lose money over the short term. Think of crypto as the stock market, Only you don\u2019t need a broker or firm and the fees for trading are much lower and more controlled by yourself. The flip side is Nothing is guaranteed and you could lose everything with much official over site. The point of cryptocurrency to unseat the global banking industry, which has had a stranglehold on our financial freedom for a century or more. DYOR and learn how to manage between both the banks impending downfall and crypto\u2019s rise for the individual\u2019s financial position above all centralized institutions."

Why would you want to use crypto to pay if you\u2019ve never really used crypto?\n\nGenerally people looking for anonymous payment situations are trying to avoid capital gains taxes on their crypto profits.\n\nBut the idea of crypto as anonymous is a huge misunderstanding. Crypto is CENSORSHIP RESISTANT not anonymous. Governments can\u2019t control who or what you do with your magic internet money but they can certainly track it.\n\nIn fact blockchains are great for tracking payment flow that\u2019s one of their primary purposes.

I have funding for the firm but I'm trying to learn how to develop (eventually at launch I'll hire or work with a vendor for this, but want to learn basics so I don't get backdoored and know what's going on).  \n\nI have to say, it's certainly not been easy to find help.  AI is a godsend but there are still funky things where I have a hard time figuring out.  It's 100% more my fault than the ADA community but what I'm saying is that there doesn't seem to be very simple tools for generating tokens/NFTs.\n\nI'm trying to run a Node as a starting point and I get a failure because my PowerShell terminal tells me that the Node-Socket cannot be created.  AI says that Windows doesn't support Sockets natively like Unix does, so I'm still trying to figure that out.  If anyone can help that would be super appreciated!"

So no you don\u2019t build apps or dApps on the CCIP because it is not a blockchain or ledger or execution layer, it has no blockspace or smart contract hosting of it\u2019s own, what you do with CCIP is plug into it, and what it means to plug into CCIP is it is a middleware protocol that lets contracts on existing chains talk to each other, CCIP provides messaging and token transfer APIs between chains. So when you \u201cuse CCIP\u201d you are really building on other blockchains, and integrating CCIP as a communication layer."
