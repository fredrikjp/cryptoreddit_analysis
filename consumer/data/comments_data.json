I've been creating industrial automation for 15 plus years, labor is not as valuable as you may think. Engineering and automation can greatly reduce or even eliminate labor in most cases. The skilled labor that goes into it is not as intensive and not fulfilling to all people's purpose, so we must think bigger. \nSome of us will labor even though we don't need to cause we want to but not laboring and being consistent and dedicated can be just as prosperous in life and with that we should rejoice. The shackles are removed and we are truly free. Have zero fear and go out and live your best life cause that's all that matters. Do what you love, cause nothing else matters."
