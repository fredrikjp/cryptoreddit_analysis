Following the 2016 DAO hack, the Ethereum community executed a hard fork\u2014an intentional change to the network's rules and state\u2014to reverse the theft. The chain that implemented this change became the modern ETH network. However, a faction of the community rejected this intervention, championing the principle of absolute immutability (\"code is law\"). They continued to validate the original, unaltered blockchain where the hack remains a permanent part of the transaction history. This original chain is Ethereum Classic (ETC). Therefore, ETC represents a preserved, historical version of the runtime that the main ETH network chose to abandon, standing as a permanent fork and a philosophical counterpoint to ETH's decision to modify its own ledger."

The Ether Machine guys may plan to take it a step further with something like preconfs to get a bit more yield (and they're far from the only ones who will do that). In terms of censorship, as long as we have something like FOCIL we can always rely on transactions getting included, though to be fair FOCIL is not designed for a world where 90% of transactions is being censored so we'll have to see how it turns out. I don't think they'd have a reason to censor your regular transactions as long as your pay a fair market price for it being included.\n\nI'm more worried about the centralization of the validator set (have been for quite some time, see my comment history). These guys will likely run a ton of validators. We should push for them _not to outsource_ this work to an existing huge staking service provider like Coinbase/Kiln/Figment/... It would be much better if they:\n\na) ran the validators themselves in a responsible way (multi-client setup - Vero/Vouch/DVT)\n\nb) used something like Rocket Pool\n\nc) used the smallest staking service provider possible (This one's harder than it looks. You want the provider to be small but at the same time, reputable)\n\nWe want to distribute the stake as evenly as we can. We can, as a community, let them know!"

Log into whatever exchange you want to use, click on the Tron asset and find your deposit address. Then send a small amount as a test, make sure it arrives, and then send everything else. Then swap it all.\n\nHonestly sending it anywhere else after you've done this is probably not a good idea, because you've admitted you (and presumably your friend, given that they're asking for your help) are clueless. Let the exchange take care of security until you get familiar with crypto. Then wait another year and then send it to a wallet.\n\nJust don't answer DMs because you will then 100% get scammed, you've been warned. Saying effectively 'help I'm a complete newbie' will only get you targeted more. First rule of crypto reddit."

In the US we don't know if some new law or tariff will be announced, redacted etc at any given moment. We don't know if we're on the edge of a recession or entering a period of stagflation. The labor market is brittle especially in tech and if AI implementation is the goal - then hiring could be deadly slow for the next 5 to 10 years. The economic / political moment we're in is just absurdly uncertain and no one knows what it represents. I find the relative main stream media quiet odd at this stage. Usually theres like 2-3 months of hype as things are starting to peak and mainstream folks start talking about crypto again. If this bull market hasn't fizzled (and while thats a possibility I don't personally think it has) out I'm hoping that we begin to see momentum at the end of summer peaking at the end of the year or in early 2026. We're just flirting w/ departing from some of the global dynamics that have been more or less constant since the 90s so. That's going to reflect in speculative markets.
